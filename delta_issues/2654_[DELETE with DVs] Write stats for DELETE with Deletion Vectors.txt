## Description

This PR gives the ability for DELETE with DVs to produce correct stats for `AddFile`s, which was a TODO item before.

Rather than from costly recomputation, the stats is obtained by copying, for each AddFile with DV, previous stats from the last commited version and change `tightBounds` to `false`. The stats is guranteed correct before the physical parquet file didn't change when doing soft deletes.

## How was this patch tested?

Modified existing tests to look at stats.
