## Description
Having the API to tell if an expression is supported on a given input schema and expected data type, can make the Kernel make better decisions in splitting the given query predicate to a guaranteed predicate and a best-effort predicate. The proposed API is:

```
    /**
     * Is the given expression evaluation supported on the data with given schema?
     *
     * @param inputSchema Schema of input data on which the expression is evaluated.
     * @param expression Expression to evaluate.
     * @param outputType Expected result data type.
     * @return true if supported and false otherwise.
     */
    boolean isSupported(StructType inputSchema, Expression expression, DataType outputType);
```
