## Description
The `DeltaTypeWideningSuite`  has grown organically as the feature was implemented and now contains a very large number of tests covering different aspects.

This change splits it into individual suites, this is fairly straightforward as the tests were already collected in multiple traits.

- Only test `widening Date -> TimestampNTZ rejected when TimestampNTZ feature isn't supported` had to be updated to explicitly disable timestampNTZ support in the test. All other tests are completely unchanged.
- All files, classes, traits are renamed from `DeltaTypeWideningX` to `TypeWideningX` and moved from `tahoe` to `tahoe.typewidening`
