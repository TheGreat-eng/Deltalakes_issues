## Bug

### Describe the problem
I tested this exact code on 10 different `dt` and 3 failed with the following error. I don't know what could possibly cause this if the other 7 dates worked as expected.
#### Steps to reproduce

```
dbutils.widgets.text('dt', '', 'dt: yyyy-MM-dd')
# 2022-05-18

silver_df = spark.sql(f"""
    select data:id::int as id
        , data:name::string as user_name
        , substring(data:location::string, 0, 100) as country_name
        , data:updated_at::string as updated_at
        , to_date(data:updated_at::string) as dt
        , dt as processed_dt
    from bronze.{table_name}
    where dt = '{dt}'
    qualify row_number() over(partition by id order by updated_at desc) = 1
    """)

(
    silver_df
    .write
    .format('delta')
    .partitionBy('dt', 'processed_dt')
    .mode('overwrite')
    .option('replaceWhere', f"processed_dt == '{dt}'")
    .saveAsTable(f"{database}.{table_name}")
)
```

#### Observed results
`AnalysisException: Data written out does not match replaceWhere 'processed_dt == '2022-05-18''.`
