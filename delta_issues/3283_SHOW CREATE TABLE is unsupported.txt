Hi delta team, I'm trying to run `SHOW CREATE TABLE` in my local development environment and the error occurs, but the statement works well in Databricks environment.

I'm wondering whether this `SHOW CREATE TABLE` feature is proprietary for Databricks? 

If it's true, is there any possible workaround for the OSS version to support `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement?

Thanks.
