## Description
Part of delta-io/delta#2071 (Partition Pruning in Kernel).

Delta `kernel-api` module creates a selection vector (a `ColumnVector` boolean data type) that goes along with `ColumnarBatch` of scan files read from the Delta checkpoint or commit files. It uses the `selection vector` to select only a subset of rows from the scan file `ColumnarBatch`. Also at the same time `kernel-api` module shouldn't be creating `ColumnVector`s. Instead should rely on the `TableClient` APIs to create the vectors.

It adds the below API on `ExpressionHandler`
```
    /**
     * Create a selection vector, a boolean type {@link ColumnVector}, on top of the range of values
     * given in <i>values</i> array.
     *
     * @param values Array of initial boolean values for the selection vector. The ownership of
     *               this array is with the caller and this method shouldn't depend on it after the
     *               call is complete.
     * @param from   start index of the range, inclusive.
     * @param to     end index of the range, exclusive.
     * @return A {@link ColumnVector} of {@code boolean} type values.
     */
    ColumnVector createSelectionVector(boolean[] values, int from, int to);
