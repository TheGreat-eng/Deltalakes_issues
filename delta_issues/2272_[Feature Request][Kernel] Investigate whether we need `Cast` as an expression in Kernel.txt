## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [x] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview
Currently, we don't have the `Cast` as a first-class expression support in Kernel expressions (See https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1997). The default expression handler can handle implicit cast where a type is being upcasted (eg. int to long).

This task is to investigate whether we need to export the `Cast` within the Kernel expression, similar to Spark DSv2.
