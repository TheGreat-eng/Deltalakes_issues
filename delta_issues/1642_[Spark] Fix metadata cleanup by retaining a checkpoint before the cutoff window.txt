## Description

We delete eligible delta files only if there's a checkpoint newer than them before the cutoff window begins.

Note: In rare cases where a checkpoint outside the cutoff window is already retained to account for timestamp-adjustments, we might end up retaining an extra checkpoint and some commit files with this change.
