Resolves #1349

Due to the unclear behavior of streaming/CDC read on column mapping tables, we decide to temporarily block batch CDC read when user has performed rename or drop column operations after enabling column mapping.
Note that the following is not blocked:
1. CDC Read from a column mapping table without rename or drop column operations.
2. Upgrade to column mapping tables.
3. Existing compatible schema change operations such as ADD COLUMN.

New unit tests.
