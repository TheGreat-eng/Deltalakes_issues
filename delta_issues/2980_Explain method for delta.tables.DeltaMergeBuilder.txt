## Feature request

### Overview

Provide a method to retrieve query plans without executing the operation through the DeltaMergeBuilder.  

Proposed that next to the `execute()` method is an `explain()` method, which returns the query plan without carrying out the merge.

### Motivation

Costly operations can often be avoided by checking the query plan prior to execution to ensure that configuration is as expected. We've been unable to find a way to get the query plan through any other means than running the operation.

### Further details

Seems like this previous issue is related to this. I'm not sure if the response rules out the proposed approach as well though: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/773
