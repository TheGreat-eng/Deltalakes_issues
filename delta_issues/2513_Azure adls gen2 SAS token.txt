Hello Everyone, I am working on a project where we are trying to save table using delta lake on a ADLS gen 2 using a SAS token. Is this even possible because I am not able to find any documentation for it. It only talks about oAuth for now for ADLS gen2. Also I am not using databricks. It is simple pyspark, deltalake and adls gen2.

If not then can I use shared key. If so how can I do it.
