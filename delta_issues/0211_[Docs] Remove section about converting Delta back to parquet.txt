## Description

Remove the section about "easily converting Delta to parquet" from the docs. This section is very misleading as this doesn't work with anything but the most trivial of Delta tables with no parquet-incompatible features enabled. For the majority of modern Delta tables, the only real option to achieve this is via CTAS or equivalent that rewrites the contents as parquet, rather than an in-place conversion.
