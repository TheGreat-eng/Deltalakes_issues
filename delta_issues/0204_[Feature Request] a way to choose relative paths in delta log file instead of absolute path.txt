## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [x] Spark
- [x] Standalone
- [x] Flink
- [x] Kernel
- [x] Other (anything that can work write data in delta format)

### Overview
Delta protocol calls out support for relative path in the log files. This path is relative to the table root directory. Provide a way to configure writers to write logs with relative paths instead of absolute paths.
It should be possible to switch between two as well.

### Motivation
- Moving data directory around in the filesystem.
- Sometimes a same filesystem can be presented as different schemes, example: ozone.

It is helpful to stick to relative paths in such cases as it increases the flexibility to choose/configure endpoints and need for editing the log files or rewrites.
