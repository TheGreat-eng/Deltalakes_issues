## Description
Currently, Delta Kernel has FileHandler.contextualize and FileReadContext API/interfaces to allow the connectors to split the scan files into chunks. However, Kernel is the one initiating these calls. It should be in the control of the connector. By making the connectors control the contextualization/splitting, we can get rid of a few interfaces/APIs from Kernel which simplifies Kernel interfaces.
