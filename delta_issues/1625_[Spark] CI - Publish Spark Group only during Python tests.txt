## Description
Python tests are specific to Spark Delta, so there is no need to publish everything.

```
        # Python tests are run only when spark group of projects are being tested.
        is_testing_spark_group = args.group is None or args.group == "spark"
        # Python tests are skipped when using Scala 2.13 as PySpark doesn't support it.
        is_testing_scala_212 = scala_version is None or scala_version.startswith("2.12")
        if is_testing_spark_group and is_testing_scala_212:
            run_python_tests(root_dir)
```
