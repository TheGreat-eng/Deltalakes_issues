### Describe the problem
Disabling DELTA_STATS_SKIPPING causes operations with DVs to fail with: `Cannot work with a non-pinned table snapshot of the TahoeFileIndex when reading a table with DVs`. The issue is caused because when we disable DELTA_STATS_SKIPPING the plan contains a TahoeLogFileIndex. This causes the requirement to fail at `PreprocessTableWithDVs.dvEnabledScanFor` to fail.

#### Steps to reproduce
The issue can be reproduced with:
```
  test("TEST non-pinned table bug") {
    withTable("delta_target") {
      withSQLConf(DeltaSQLConf.DELTA_STATS_SKIPPING.key -> false.toString) {
        sql(
          s"""
             |CREATE TABLE delta_target(key2 INT, value INT)
             |USING delta
             |OPTIONS('path'='$tempPath')
        """.stripMargin)

        sql("DELETE FROM delta_target WHERE key2 = 0")
        sql("SELECT key2, value FROM delta_target").collect()
      }
    }
  }
```
