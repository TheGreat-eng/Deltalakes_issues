Hello,

I am currently working on storing Delta Lake tables in a Cloudflare R2 bucket and need clarification on how to specify the bucket path for R2 when using DuckDB and Delta Lake, as well as the overall process involved.

I am utilizing the S3-compatible API, formatted as follows: `https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/{bucket_name}`.

Below is a code snippet I am using to store data in my R2 bucket via the DuckDB Delta Lake extension. This code is part of a custom Dagster `ConfigurableIOManager` class and defines the actions taken when an asset returns an output (in this case, a DataFrame). The goal is to save the data obtained from the asset as a Delta Lake table stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket:

```python
def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    df = obj.copy()
    df["year"] = df["timestamp"].dt.year
    df["month"] = df["timestamp"].dt.month
    df["day"] = df["timestamp"].dt.day
    write_deltalake(
        self.r2_url,
        df,
        partition_by=["year", "month", "day"],
        mode="overwrite"
        if context.run_id
        not in [run.run_id for run in DagsterInstance.get().get_runs()]
        else "append",
    )
```

The variable `self.r2_url` holds the S3-compatible URL for the Cloudflare bucket, which follows this format: `https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/{bucket_name}/`.

While running the pipeline, I encounter the following error:

```
pyo3_runtime.PanicException: The specified table_uri is not valid: InvalidTableLocation("Unknown scheme: https")
```

I have attempted using different prefixes besides `https`, such as `r2`, but encountered the same error. When I try using `s3`, I receive this error:

```
OSError: The operation lacked the necessary privileges to complete for path ohlc/_delta_log/_last_checkpoint: Client error with status 403 Forbidden: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error><Code>InvalidAccessKeyId</Code><Message>The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.</Message>
```

I am confused about why the access key ID is reported as invalid. I am sure that it is correct, my only other explanation is that the URL with `s3` as the prefix might also be incorrect.

Would love any help on how to resolve these issues and correctly configure the storage of Delta Lake tables in a Cloudflare R2 bucket? Thank you in advance.
