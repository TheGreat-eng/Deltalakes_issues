## Description

Move unidoc settings from `crossSparkSettings()` to the spark project definition since they are duplicated. This simplifies sbt definition for delta-connect projects that need the `crossSparkSettings()` but don't have javadocs enabled.

Compilation fails when this is provided
```
    scalacOptions ++= Seq(
      "-P:genjavadoc:strictVisibility=true" // hide package private types and methods in javadoc
    ),
```
_and_ javadocs are not enabled.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests suffice it's a refactoring.
