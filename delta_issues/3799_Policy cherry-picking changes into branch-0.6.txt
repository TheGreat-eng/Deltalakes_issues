Hello,

Does the Delta Lake team have a policy about whether you will accept PRs to cherry-pick changes from `master` into `branch-0.6`?  Can community members port bugfixes or features to enable them in Spark 2.4.x (regardless of whether there will be any official Delta 0.6.x releases in the future)?

Thanks,
