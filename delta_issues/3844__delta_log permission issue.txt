Environment: Spark Standalone in a distributed cluster.
Spark Worker Nodes are running with userid "X".
Spark Driver runs as userid "Peter" and start a Spark Job wich creates a delta lake table.

Problem:
The part-000.....snappy.parquet files are written by user X (which is correct from my point of view)
The folder _delta_log belongs to user "Peter". Also the files created in this folder belong to "Peter".

When Spark driver starts another spark job with userid "Tom". He will get Permission denied, because he has no access to _delta_log since the folder belongs to Peter.

Expected behavior:
All files and folders are created by userid "X".
