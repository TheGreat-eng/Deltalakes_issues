## Description

This PR makes the write command behave similarly to delete, update, and merge, in that it will not write an empty commit to the transaction log.

Resolves #1933 

## How was this patch tested?

Working on testing this locally, `sbt test` hangs on the `hiveTez` suite currently.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, if the user consumes the delta transaction log and would expect an empty write transaction to include a record in the log.
