## Description
This PR is part of https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1959

In this PR, we introduce the IdentityColumnsTableFeature to test-only so that we can start developing with it.

Note, we do not add support to minWriterVersion 6 yet to properties.defaults.minWriterVersion because that will enable the table feature outside of testing.

## How was this patch tested?
Existing tests pass. 

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No, this is a test-only change.
