### Describe the problem
Spark-delta cannot deserialize a delta table history where the operationMetrics contain integers instead of string values. This violates the Delta Protocol, since it should be able to deserialize any format: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#commit-provenance-information

`Implementations are free to store any valid JSON-formatted data via the commitInfo action.`


#### Steps to reproduce
Write a delta table with Delta-RS, do any operation that provides operationMetrics in the commitInfo and then try to do Table.history() with spark-delta.



#### Observed results

What you will get is this since it expects a string even though the protocol permits any value.
