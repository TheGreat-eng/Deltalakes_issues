This is the official for discussing support for Delta Lake on S3 while writing from multiple clusters. The challenges of S3 support have been explained in #39 . While #39 tracks the work for a simpler solution that works only with all write operations going through the same cluster/driver/JVM, this issues tracks the larger problem of making it work with multiple clusters.
