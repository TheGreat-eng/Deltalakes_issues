## Description
Fix a bug in resource handling where we are always closing the resources which should be closed only when a failure occurs.

Currently, the code opens two resources, it maintains the opened resource list to close in case the function isn't successful in opening all the required resources. Resources in the maintained list should only be closed when an error occurs (it should be in the `catch` block not in `finally`)
