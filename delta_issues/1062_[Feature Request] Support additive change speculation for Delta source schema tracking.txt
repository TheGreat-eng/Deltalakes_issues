### Overview

We currently support `schemaTrackingLocation` ([doc](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-streaming.html#tracking-non-additive-schema-changes)) that allows Delta streaming source to track additive **and non-additive** schema changes during streaming from a Delta table.

Right now, every single schema changes would cause a new schema version to be generated in the tracking location, however, it might not be necessary for non-backward incompatible changes like ADD COLUMN. One way is to speculate ahead in the Delta log, skip over the ADD COLUMN schema changes, and use the encompassing schema as the stream read schema. 

### Motivation

This could allow possibly a lot fewer stream restarts due to ADD COLUMN schema changes.

### Further details

The speculation ahead can be potentially implemented [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/a24a857d27bbb4b3585814c35fa3002cee929fec/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/sources/DeltaSourceMetadataTrackingLog.scala#L316)
