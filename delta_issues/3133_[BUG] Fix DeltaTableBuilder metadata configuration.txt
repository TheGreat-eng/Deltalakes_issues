## Bug

### Describe the problem

Currently, when `DeltaTableBuilder` is given a property that does not start with a `delta.` prefix, then that property is written to the table metadata in all lowercase.

#### Steps to reproduce

```scala
io.delta.tables.DeltaTable.create()
  .addColumn("bar", StringType)
  .property("dataSkippingNumIndexedCols", "33")
  .tableName("my_table")
  .execute()
```

#### Observed results

This will incorrectly write `dataskippingnumindexedcols` to the delta log metadata.

#### Expected results

We want to preserve the case of table properties. `dataSkippingNumIndexedCols` should be written to the metadata.

### Implementation Requirement

In addition to fixing the above issue, we also need to be backwards compatible and be able to read older tables with these invalid properties.

As well, you need to include a **flag** that can be enabled to roll back to this previous behaviour.

After you fix this issue, please update the test and test output table here: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/DeltaWriteConfigsSuite.scala#L316

Also, please add tests with the feature flag enabled/disabled, as well as by reading an "older" table with these invalid delta properties (this should go into [EvolvabilitySuite](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/EvolvabilitySuite.scala)).
