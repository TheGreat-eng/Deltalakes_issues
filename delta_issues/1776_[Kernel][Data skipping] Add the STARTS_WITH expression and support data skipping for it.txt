## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
<!--
Please add the component selected below to the beginning of the issue title
For example: [Feature Request][Spark] Title of my issue
-->

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [X] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview

Currently Kernel supports a limited set of expressions. We should 1) add the STARTS_WITH expression and 2) use file statistics to prune files based on the expression.

### Motivation

Better file pruning.

### Further details

This means we should
1) add STARTS_WITH to the Kernel [Predicate](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/expressions/Predicate.java) and support it in the kernel-defaults project
2) Generate a data skipping filter according to the [same rules](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/stats/DataSkippingReader.scala#L542) we use in delta-spark
