Hello,

This is related to issue #282.

With this PR:
- A setup.py file is added. 
- Circleci workflow is updated to release the package on PyPI when a tag starting with `v` is created.

Need to address the following:
- Get a username and password for PyPI. The username will be added in config.yml (`<username>`), whereas the password will be stored in `$PYPI_PASSWORD` env variable in circleci. 
- Review the metadata in setup.py and decide what the `author` and `author_email` values should be. I also used `delta.io` as the package name since `delta` was used already. 
- Added `pyspark` as an install dependency (i.e. will get installed when you do `pip install delta.io`) but whether it needs to stay there is open for discussion.
