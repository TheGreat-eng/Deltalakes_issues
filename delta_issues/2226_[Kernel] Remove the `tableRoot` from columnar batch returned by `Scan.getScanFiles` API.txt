### Description
This is a [leftover](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2069/files#r1333808531) TODO from this log replay PR. The schema of the columnar batch returned by `Scan.getScanFiles` is as follows:

```
 - root
    - add: struct
       - path: String (this is absolute or relative path)
       - ..
       - deletionVector: struct
       - ...
    - tableRoot: Absolute path of the table location.
```

The consumers of the API need to stitch together the `tableRoot` and `add.path` in order to create an absolute path for the scan file. This issue is to remove such need for path construction by directly outputting the `add.path` as an absolute path.
