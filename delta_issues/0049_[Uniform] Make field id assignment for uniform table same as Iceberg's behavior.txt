This PR fixes an issue where REPLACE in uniform mode is not setting field IDs correctly.

The uniform conversion was not successful in the following situation:
1. Create a table with uniform mode and a schema with two fields
2. Replace the table with a new schema with one field

This is because currently we don't assign field IDs based on the previous last_column_id on replace table operations, which is not compatible with Iceberg's approach to field ID assignment.

For context, iceberg field id assignment will always starts from previous last_column_id, with reusing only the name matches.
