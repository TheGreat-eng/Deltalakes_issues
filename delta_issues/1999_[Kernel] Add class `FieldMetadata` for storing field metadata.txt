## Description

Resolves #2315

Adds a class `FieldMetadata` for storing `StructField` metadata. Currently field metadata is stored as a `Map<String, String>`; this is not sufficient for column level metadata as values are stored in JSON as strings, numbers, lists, etc (for example column mapping id is stored as a long).

The `FieldMetadata` class allows us to restrict the possible value types through its builder class. This will be important in the future when we support writes.

Full `FieldMetadata` parsing support in the `DefaultJsonHandler` is also added in this PR.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests and adds tests for the JSON parsing.
