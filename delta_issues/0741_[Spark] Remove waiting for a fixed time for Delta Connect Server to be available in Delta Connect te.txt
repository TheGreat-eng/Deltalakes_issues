## Description
For local E2E Delta Connect testing, we also designed an [util class](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/01bf60743b77c47147843e9083129320490f1629/spark-connect/client/src/test/scala-spark-master/io/delta/connect/tables/RemoteSparkSession.scala#L62) to start a local server in a different process similar to [SparkConnect](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ba208b9ca99990fa329c36b28d0aa2a5f4d0a77e/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/test/RemoteSparkSession.scala#L37).

We noticed that the server takes a random amount of seconds to start up, and back then we received the error `INVALID_HANDLE.SESSION_NOT_FOUND] The handle 746e6c86-9fa9-4b08-9572-388c20eaed47 is invalid. Session not found. SQLSTATE: HY000"`, so what we did is to add a 10s `Thread.sleep` before starting the client.

This is not robust, so we are removing the `Thread.sleep`. This should work because:
1. The SparkSession's builder here already uses the default [Configuration](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3edc9c23a723a92c5a951cea0436529de65c640a/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession.scala#L891) of the `SparkConnectClient` which includes a default retry policy.
2. Spark patches the error `INVALID_HANDLE.SESSION_NOT_FOUND` in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46971) at some point, so we should be able to retry even if encountering this error.
