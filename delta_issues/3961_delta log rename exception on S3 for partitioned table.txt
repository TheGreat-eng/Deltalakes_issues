Hi, we are on delta 0.5 version and have some delta partitioned tables on S3. we are using pyspark on EMR to manage DeltaTables.

after we upgraded to 0.5, we started noticing following exception while doing compaction on individual partitions.

these exceptions are re-producible and random on any partition while doing this job sequentially on each partition. 

java.io.IOException: rename from s3://some-s3-bucket/delta/tables/dltable/_delta_log/.00000000000000002214.json.7aa85f40-03f5-426d-b518-55f1b350d794.tmp to s3://some-s3-bucket/delta/tables/dltable/_delta_log/00000000000000002214.json failed.

Please let us know if there is any way, to resolve this exception.
