## Description

#4020 removed a duplicate `verifyDeltaVersions` function, however this PR reverts that change, as that duplicate function has slightly different semantics. Basically, now this function is called both when asking for the changes of a table between two versions, and when constructing a Snapshot. For example, the error message thrown currently `Requested table changes beginning with startVersion=%s but no log ...` is not applicable for a Snapshot.

I've tried several ways to unify this ... but for now, let's just revert this change and then I can submit a new PR that does this a bit better.

Btw, this PR keeps 2 minor changes from #4020:
- keeping the rename of "continuous" to "contiguous".
- keeping the changing of `latestAvailableVersion` from an Optional<Long> to a long in `DeltaErrors::endVersionNotFound`

## How was this patch tested?

Existing UTs.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
