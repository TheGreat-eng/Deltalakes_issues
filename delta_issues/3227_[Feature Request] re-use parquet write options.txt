## Feature request

### Overview

It is very easy to change the compression codec used to write parquet files when using format "parquet". Example:
```scala
df.write.format("parquet").option("compression", "gzip").save("/path/to/somewhere")
```

However, in case of format "delta", one has to set the Spark conf `spark.sql.parquet.compression.codec` instead. Would be nice to read to "compression" option to keep the same user-friendlyness of "parquet".
```scala
df.write.format("delta").option("compression", "gzip").save("/path/to/somewhere")
```

NB: the above does not work, eventually compression used is snappy instead of gzip (tested with delta-io 0.6.1)

### Motivation

Keep same interface to set compression option when using `delta` instead of `parquet` format.
