## Feature request

### Overview

Currently, the `DELETE` operation returns an empty result. It would be more useful if it returned the number of deleted rows.

### Motivation

The number of deleted rows is an obvious metric that users would want from a delete operation.

### Further details

Currently, `DeleteCommand.scala` is explicitly returning an empty `DataFrame` [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/DeleteCommand.scala#L98). Instead, we could use the `metrics` member field to return the `numDeletedRows`.

Make sure to add tests, too :)
