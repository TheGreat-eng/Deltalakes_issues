### Overview

All of our `DataType` classes provide `toJson` which serializes the type following the delta protocol schema serialization rules https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#schema-serialization-format. We use this method to serialize the physical and logical schemas in `ScanStateRow`.

`toJson` is only tested by the 2 round-trip tests in `DefaultJsonHandlerSuite`. We should add more thorough tests for `toJson`.
