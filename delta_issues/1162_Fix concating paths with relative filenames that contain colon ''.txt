## Description

This PR fixes an issue where the `safeConcatPaths` method throws an exception when the `relativeChildPath` contains a colon `:`. Such a character is not allowed in Hadoop paths due to ambiguity (`aa:bb.csv` can be interpreted as an absolute path like `aa://bb.csv` where `aa` is the scheme), but is allowed in many file systems such as S3. Thus we need to handle this case.

The fix here is to prepend a `/` so that Hadoop will know that everything after `/` belongs to the path, not the scheme.

## How was this patch tested?

New tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Nope.
