## Description

Create new workflow `spark_examples_test.yaml` that compiles the `examples/scala/build.sbt` project.

Also fixes such compilation so that it uses the local jars (previously it was incorrectly hardcoded to Delta 3.0).

This requires running `publishM2` beforehand.

## How was this patch tested?

CI tests and specifically tested on a commit that uses a new `clusterBy` API in 3.2: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3012

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
