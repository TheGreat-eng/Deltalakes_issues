With Apache Spark you can create a hive table and map it to a delta lake table. You can read (SELECT) and write (INSERT) to the table. Executing a DESCRIBE TABLE table_identifier statement returns metadata information, but if you query a statement like SHOW COLUMNS table_identifier it shows no columns.

BI tools connect with the STS (Spark Thrift Server) which uses hive tables and not showing columns has problems with not loading tables because of error messages like: "table has no visible columns and cannot be queried".

This has been tested with Spark 3.0.1 and the Delta Lake package "delta-core_2.12-0.8.0".
