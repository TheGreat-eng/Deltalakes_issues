## Feature request

### Overview
The currently the exceptions thrown by the `kernel-api` or `kernel-defaults` module are arbitary and there is no easy way to distinguish between user (in this case connector) errors vs Delta table reading issues.


### Further details
Goals
* Want to define an exception where user (connector) errors are clearly distinguishable from the Kernel errors
* Error codes?

Tasks:
* Design and discussion - 2days
* Implementation of exception infra - 3days
   * We wonâ€™t be updating all of the existing code as part of this task.
