## Description

This PR patches the check in DeltaColumnMapping.verifyAndUpdateMetadataChange. Table protocols should not need to support both reader table features and writer table features for it to support Column Mapping.

For example, if a table has protocol version minReaderVersion=2 and minWriterVersion=7, it should be able to upgrade to column mapping. Right now, the system asks the user to upgrade to minReaderVersion=3, which is unnecessary.

## How was this patch tested?

New test.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
