## Description

Adds a github action that can be manually triggered to publish the javadocs using github pages.

This was adapted from the starter workflow suggested by github actions (when you go to the Pages settings and select github actions to deploy).

## How was this patch tested?

Merged this code into my own fork and ran the github actions.
