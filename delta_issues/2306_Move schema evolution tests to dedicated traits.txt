## Description

Schema evolution tests are moved out of `MergeIntoSuiteBase` and collected in separated test traits to allow more flexibility when running tests with different combinations of parameters in the future:
- MergeIntoSchemaEvolutionCoreTests: a very small subset of tests intended to be run with a large number of varying combinations to preserve core test coverage with e.g. CDF, DVs, column mapping.
- MergeIntoSchemaEvolutionBaseTests: All basic schema evolution tests - and by extension tests that don't fit in other traits.
- MergeIntoSchemaEvolutionNotMatchedBySourceTests: Tests covering schema evolution with NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE clauses.
- MergeIntoNestedStructEvolutionTests: Tests covering nested struct evolution.

## How was this patch tested?
This is a refactor of existing tests.
