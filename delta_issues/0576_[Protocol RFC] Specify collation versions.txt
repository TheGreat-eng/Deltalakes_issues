## Description

In this PR, we amend the current RFC proposal for the Collations table feature. 

* We should not have readVersion hints as part of the table, since the choice of collation versions is a decision at the engine level. For e.g. consider a join between two tables with different collation versions.
* We also specify the Reader Requirements and Write Requirements more explicitly for the table feature.
