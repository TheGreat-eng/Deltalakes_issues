## Description
This is a small refactor to `MergeCDCSuite` to create a second, smaller suite `MergeCDCCoreSuite` that only runs CDC tests defined in that same file.
This allows running a small number of tests with high CDC coverage instead of running the (very) large number of tests defined in `MergeIntoSQLSuite` every time.

## How was this patch tested?
Running the tests

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No
