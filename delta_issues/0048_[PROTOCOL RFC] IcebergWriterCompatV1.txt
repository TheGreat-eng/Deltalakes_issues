## Protocol Change Request

### Description of the protocol change

This protocol change introduces a new compatibility flag, which ensures that a delta table can be safely
read and written as an Apache Icebergâ„¢ format table, similar to [IcebergCompatV1](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#iceberg-compatibility-v1) and [IcebergCompatV2](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#iceberg-compatibility-v2).

It will introduce a number of limitations on a delta table, including limiting which table features and types can be used. For details on the exact requirements see [the RFC](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4285).
