### Overview

I want to create a MOR Delta Table. The main feature of MOR tables is `deletion_vector` files. And they are generated only when we explicitly delete rows using `DELETE FROM` query. 
I use `MERGE INTO` query to merge the incrementals into my base table. It also includes `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN DELETE`. But it doesn't generate `deletion_vector` files as it is not a direct `DELETE FROM` query.
So, I tried using `DELETE FROM WHERE <>` , but got an error saying: 
`[DELTA_UNSUPPORTED_SUBQUERY] Subqueries are not supported in the DELETE`.

### Motivation

So, people who want to build a MOR Delta Table will benefit from this. Because if a dataset is large enough and we generally include the DELETE in the MERGE INTO query itself. If that doesn't generate deletion_vector files then it is difficult to use DELETE FROM as we will always have a sub-query for this.

Request to add this functionality in upcoming releases. Thanks!
