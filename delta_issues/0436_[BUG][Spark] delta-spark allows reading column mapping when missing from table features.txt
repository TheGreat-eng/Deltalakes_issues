### Describe the problem

TLDR you can relatively easily create a table which (according to the protocol) shouldn't allow column mapping, but is read with column mapping in delta-spark.

I think there are two pieces to this issue:
1. [bug] delta-spark uses column mapping to read a table without column mapping in table reader features
2. [api sharp edge?] delta's `upgradeTableProtocol` will upgrade from reader version 2 to reader version 3 without adding any table features. This is a problem since it effectively silently turns of column mapping. (since it is enabled/supported in reader version 2 but requires that the table feature be present when reader version is 3)

#### Steps to reproduce
See example below for code implementing these steps:
1. the table is created with reader version 2 and writer version 7 with `"writerFeatures":["columnMapping","icebergCompatV1"]` and `delta.columnMapping.mode = name`
2. then `upgradeTableProtocol(3, 7)` gives reader version 3 with no reader features. this effectively turns off column mapping.
3. when reading the table it looks like it is read with `columnMapping = name`

```python
# using pyspark
df = get_sample_data(spark)
delta_path = str(Path(case.delta_root).absolute())
# table at version 0
delta_table: DeltaTable = (
    DeltaTable.create(spark)
    .location(delta_path)
    .addColumns(df.schema)
    .property("delta.enableIcebergCompatV1", "true")
    .execute()
)
delta_table.upgradeTableProtocol(3, 7)
df.repartition(1).write.format("delta").mode("append").save(case.delta_root)
```
