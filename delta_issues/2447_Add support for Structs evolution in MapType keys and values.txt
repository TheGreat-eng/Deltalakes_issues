## Description

This PR resolves issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1641 to allow automatic schema evolution in structs that are inside maps.

Assuming the target and source tables have the following schemas:
target: `id string, map map<int, struct<a: int, b: int>>`
source: `id string, map map<int, struct<a: int, b: int, c: int>>`
```
SET spark.databricks.delta.schema.autoMerge.enabled = true;

MERGE INTO target t
USING source s
ON t.id = s.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *
```
returns an analysis error today:
```
AnalysisException: cannot resolve 's.map' due to data type mismatch: cannot cast map<string,struct<a:int,b:int>> to map<string,struct<a:int,b:int,c:string>>;
```

With this change, the merge command succeeds and the target table schema evolves to include field `c` inside the map value. The same also works for map keys.

## How was this patch tested?
- Tests are added to `MergeIntoSuiteBase` and `MergeIntoSQLSuite` to cover struct evolution inside of maps values and keys.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
Yes, struct evolution inside of maps now succeeds instead of failing with an analysis error, see previous example.
