### Overview
Currently the Kernel or Connector CI job just runs the tests and doesn't generate any docs to make sure there are no errors introduced in the PRs. Doc generation is [done as part of the `delta-spark` tests](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/run-tests.py#L72) which are not run if the PR just contains Kernel only changes. 

May be it is better to separate out the unidoc generation into a separate CI workflow that always runs?
