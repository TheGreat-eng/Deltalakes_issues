## Feature request

### Overview

Allows users to create a Delta table that includes a period when using back ticks in the table DDL. Current error message when trying to create a table with a period:

Error in SQL statement: AnalysisException:`schema.name_of_table` is not a valid name for tables/databases. Valid names only contain alphabet characters, numbers and _.

** Back ticks are not shown in the text above, but the table name contains back ticks.


### Motivation

This feature will simplify migrations and allow a separation of namespaces similar to schemas in traditional databases. Projects that are migrating tables from traditional databases will be allowed to use the same names for the tables. Using an underscore to replace the period is not acceptable, because some table names already contain the underscore and it would not provide a distinction between namespaces.

Common examples of how this could be useful:

 - CREATE TABLE `bronze.product`
 - CREATE TABLE `silver.product`
 - CREATE TABLE `inventory.warehouse_location`
** Back ticks are not shown in the text above, but the table name contains back ticks.
 
I believe the best example is to facilitate the migration from other databases to Delta lake.
