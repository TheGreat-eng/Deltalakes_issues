### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
Spark structured logging ([SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rATVGmFLNVLmtxSpWrEceYm7d-ocgu8ofhryVs4g3XU/edit?pli=1#heading=h.rks22ljmjzmt)) aims to provide more analyzable logs by changing the plain text logs to a structured JSON format. Spark has introduced a new set of structured logging APIs and is currently working on [migration](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47240).
### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->
Currently, analyzing Delta text logs can be challenging. Structured logging will make the logs easier to understand and directly queryable using Spark SQL. It will simplify the debugging process and facilitate more efficient log analysis.
