## Bug
A couple of weeks ago, I started a project that uses Synapse Spark 3.3 and has been using MERGE (both pyspark & Spark SQL) feature and has been getting the above error.

### Describe the problem
The error seems to be related to the number of columns in the table, as the 560 above is the actual size of the table that I am having an issue with, while tables with less than 95 columns do not have the issue. I have seen some reports in the MS community (https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/104453) about 3.3 not supporting more than 95 columns. 

When I revert to Spark 3.2, running the same code with the snippets below does not throw the error.

#### Steps to reproduce
`            deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, sourcePath)
            (deltaTable.alias("t").merge(
                df.alias("s"),
                "t.meta_DerivedID = s.meta_DerivedID")
            .whenMatchedUpdate(set =
                {
                "meta_active": "s.meta_active",
                "meta_modified": "s.meta_modified",
                }
            )
            .whenNotMatchedInsertAll()
            .execute()
            )
