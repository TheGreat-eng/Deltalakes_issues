## Description

This is a small fix that changes the `sizeCollectorInputEncoders` in `DataSkippingReader` to a `lazy val`. We are already doing this for other encoders in the codebases (e.g. see [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/actions/actions.scala#L106)) in order to prevent initialization failures of those encoders during JVM startup.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests are sufficient as this does make any logical changes.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
