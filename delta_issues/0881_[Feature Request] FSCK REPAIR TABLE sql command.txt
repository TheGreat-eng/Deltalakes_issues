## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [X] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview

The problem: Sometimes, it is possible that a delta log references parquet files or deletion vector files that do not exist in the filesystem. One specific example of that can happen when the following sequence of actions occurs:
1. A table is created and several entries are added
2. Some files are deleted
3. Vacuum command is applied to physically remove the deleted files
4. We time travel to a version of the table before step 2 has happened
In this case we end up with a table that has a reference to a file but that file has been vacuumed so the table becomes not usable.

Right now, we have no way of selecting from tables that have delta log references to missing files. The FSCK command would make the table usable by removing those references.

### Motivation

This feature will be used to make the table usable again. At the moment, if a Delta Log contains a reference to a file that does not exist in the filesystem, an error is thrown.

Users have previously requested this feature to be added. See https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/748#issuecomment-930724418

### Further details

Some of the features this command should have:
- Remove references to the parquet files that are not found in the filesystem
- Report any files that have a deletion vector, but the referenced deletion vector file is missing
- Have a DRY RUN mode that would allow the user to see which files will be removed without actually performing the removal

### Willingness to contribute

- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.
- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the Delta Lake community.
- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.
