Currently, `DeltaMergeBuilder` performs a custom relation deduplication logic reminiscent to the DeduplicateRelations analyzer rule. This duplicates logic and might cause issues from unforeseen interaction with the rule during the analysis of the MERGE plan. This PR refactors the deduplication in DeltaMergeBuilder to utilise the `DeduplicateRelations` rule. The new flow is as follows:

1. Un-resolve the ambiguous pre-resolved references.
2. Invoke DeduplicateRelations to do the deduplication work with FakeLogicalPlan.
3. Use the deduplicated source and target plan in the final MERGE command.
