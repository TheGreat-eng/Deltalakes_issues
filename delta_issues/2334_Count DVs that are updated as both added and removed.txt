## Description

Increase DV metrics "added" and "removed" for all DVs that have been "updated" because, from Delta Log's perspective, an "update" action is equivalent to a "remove" followed by an "add". Updating the counting rule will ensure that the metric reflects more accurately what happened at a lower level.

## How was this patch tested?

Updating existing tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, they'll see the change in DV metrics.
