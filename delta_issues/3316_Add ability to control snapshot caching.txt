For certain scenarios, it's not ideal to have the snapshot cached in memory all the time. Specifically, for append-only streaming workloads with dynamic allocation, caching of the snapshot can make it trickier to get rid of resources as soon as they should be free. You either need to set a cached executor timeout, or manually try to uncache the DeltaLog (which has no Python public way to do this, you have to manually go through the JVM to do it)

This could be solved if there was a simple way to configure the cache level of snapshots
