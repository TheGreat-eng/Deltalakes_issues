### Overview

Support Catalog Integration throughout Delta codebase for DDL. 

### Motivation

Delta is currently entirely file system based and lacks catalog integration. This is painful when interaction with HMS as the fields like schema and table properties are not correctly updated in HMS with DDL. 

### Further details

The feature proposes to pass objects like CatalogTable from all DDL/DML commands to OptimisticTransaction, which then would be catalog-aware, so users (or features) can register post-commit hooks that talk to the catalog.
