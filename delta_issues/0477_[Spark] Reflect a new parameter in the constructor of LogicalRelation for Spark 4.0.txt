## Description

This PR proposes to reflect a new parameter in the constructor of LogicalRelation for Spark 4.0. This PR deals with it via creating a shim object like we have done with IncrementalExecution for parameters difference.

There are overloaded methods to create a LogicalRelation instance and Spark community tried to provide the new method to avoid this change, but Spark couldn't just add a new overloaded method to workaround as it was ambiguous with existing method with default param.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
