## Description

This PR does the following:
- changes our DeltaLogActionUtils `listDeltaLogFiles` method to return an iterator. This will eventually let it be used in a followup PR to further consolidate and clean up code in DeltaHistoryManager (which lists the delta log and expects an iterator)
- adds CloseabelIterator::takeWhile, breakableFilter, and toInMemoryList

## How was this patch tested?

- New UTs

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
