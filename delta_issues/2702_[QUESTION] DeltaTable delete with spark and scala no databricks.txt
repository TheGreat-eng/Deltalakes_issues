Question1:
I see only three executors doing DeltaFileOperations: Listing
INFO DeltaFileOperations: Listing s3a://BUCKET/TABLE/date=...

Why only 3 executors are involved in listing and it is not parallelized more?

Question2:
I do not see partitioned files being deleted when I run it in aws s3

Question3: 
All works well when I run it in Azure: partitions are deleted.

Question4:
When I run it in azure then I see also:
