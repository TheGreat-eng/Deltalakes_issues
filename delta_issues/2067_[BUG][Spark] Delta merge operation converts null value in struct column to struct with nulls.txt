## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [x] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem

I have stored data (which includes a column containing structs and contains **null** values) and I want to update this data using the delta merge operation. The new data contains several new columns (not present in the stored data), so I have set `spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.schema.autoMerge.enabled", True)`. The new data also contains a column containing structs, and again the value is sometimes **null**. After inspecting the results I noticed that the **null** values in the new struct column have been changed to a struct with every field set to **null**. Additionally, the struct column already present in the stored data has been converted as well.

#### Steps to reproduce

```import pyspark.sql.functions as F
from pyspark.sql.types import StructField, StructType, IntegerType
from delta import DeltaTable

path_to_delta_file = "/path/to/delta/file"

schema = StructType([StructField("id", IntegerType(), True), 
                     StructField("struct_col", StructType([StructField("a", IntegerType(), True), StructField("b", IntegerType(), True)]))])

df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, {"a": 1, "b": 2}), (2, None)], schema=schema)
df.write.save(path_to_delta_file)

updates_df = df.withColumn("extra_struct", F.col("struct_col"))

spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.schema.autoMerge.enabled", True)

delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, path_to_delta_file)

delta_table.alias("stored_data").merge(
    updates_df.alias("updates"),
    "stored_data.id <=> updates.id").whenMatchedUpdateAll().execute()
```


#### Observed results

The results after the merge operation look like this:

#### Expected results

I would expect the results to look like this (which is also what they look like when I display the dataframe before the merge operation):

#### Further details

I am running this code on Azure Databricks (runtime version 13,3).
