In `MergeIntoCommand`, it uses a inner join to find touched files. But the targetDF contains some non-deterministic columns (e.g `FILE_NAME_COL`). That will prevent the target table from applying parquet filter pushdown. So current implementation scans all rows in parquet files of targetDF (has skipped the files which not contains any matched rows). But in the worst case, it still could scan all data in the whole target table. So we need to add a filter before adding `withColumn` to enable the Parquet filter pushdown. Without this patch, the PushedFilters in FileScanExec is empty. With this patch, all target only predicates could be pushdown to parquet FileScanExec.
