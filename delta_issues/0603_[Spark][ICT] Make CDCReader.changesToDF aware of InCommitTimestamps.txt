Context: Currently CDCReader.changesToDF relies on DeltaHistoryManager.getCommits for getting a list of commits and their timestamps. Since DeltaHistoryManager.getCommits is not aware of InCommitTimestamps and Coordinated Commits, it will either return the wrong timestamp or no timestamp at all for certain commits. 

This PR updates CDCReader.changesToDF so that it only relies on DeltaHistoryManager.getCommits for non-ICT commits. The rest of CDCReader.changesToDF relies on the output of deltaLog.getChanges which is already Coordinated Commit-aware. The function also already extracts the `CommitInfo` for all of these commits, which we reuse to get the In-Commit Timestamp for relevant commits. Since the actions were already being read in the function, this PR does not add any additional IO.
This PR also updates `DeltaSource` so that it propagates `CommitInfo` actions to `CDCReader.changesToDF`. These `CommitInfo` actions are only used for InCommitTimestamps are later filtered out.
