#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
<!--
Please add the component selected below to the beginning of the issue title

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone

- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem

Since this PR https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3587 the delta-kernel-api includes a shaded version of Jackson to avoid dependency problems with connector developers.

But the published maven artifacts include jackson dependencies, so any project that uses `delta-kernel-api` might have conflicts

See for example:
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/iodelta-1181/io/delta/delta-kernel-api/3.3.0/delta-kernel-api-3.3.0.pom 

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
  <version>2.13.5</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.13.5</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-annotations</artifactId>
  <version>2.13.5</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-datatype-jdk8</artifactId>
  <version>2.13.5</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Steps to reproduce

Add `delta-kernel-api` `3.3.0` dependency in a maven project
<!--
Please include copy-pastable code snippets if possible.

#### Observed results

Jackson dependencies are included
<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->

#### Expected results

Jackson dependencies are not included as they are shaded inside the `delta-kernel-api` jar
<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->

#### Further details

<!--
Include any additional details that may be useful for diagnosing the problem here. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

As a workaround one can explicitly exclude the `jackson` libraries when declaring the dependency, ie:

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.delta</groupId>
            <artifactId>delta-kernel-api</artifactId>
            <version>${delta-kernel.version}</version>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jackson-core</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jackson-annotations</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jackson-datatype-jdk8</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
