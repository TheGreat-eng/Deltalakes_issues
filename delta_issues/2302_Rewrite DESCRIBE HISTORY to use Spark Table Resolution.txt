## Description

This PR updates the Delta Lake DESCRIBE HISTORY command to work with V1 and V2 tables.

It rewrites the Delta DESCRIBE HISTORY command to use Spark's table resolution logic instead of resolving the target table manually at command execution time. For that, it changes `DescribeDeltaHistoryCommand` from a LeafRunnableCommand to a UnaryLike command that takes an UnresolvedTable as a child plan node, which will be resolved by Spark. In addition, it also uses an `UnresolvedPathBasedDeltaTable` LogicalPlan for the case that `DESCRIBE HISTORY` is run against a raw path. This logical plan is an indication that the target table specified as a path so no table resolution is necessary.

## How was this patch tested?

This PR modifies a subset of existing unit tests and in general is covered by the entire body of existing DESCRIBE HISTORY test coverage.
