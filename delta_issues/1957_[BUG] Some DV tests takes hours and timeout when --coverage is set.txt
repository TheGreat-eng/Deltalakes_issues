## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
- [X] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem
When --coverage is set these 2 tests takes hours. In my local machine it took more than 4 hours and failed. The error message says 20 minutes timeout, but it takes hours.

Created this Test PR to repro it: #2357
Build link: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/actions/runs/7080976561/job/19269609811?pr=2357

#### Steps to reproduce
You can run using the run-test.py or java command directly to filter this test only. I tested the java command without the JVM flags set by python script (-J-XX:+UseG1GC, etc), to validate they were not the problem, and the issue persists:

`python run-tests.py --group spark --coverage`

or

```
sbt
coverage
project spark
testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.delta.deletionvectors.DeletionVectorsSuite -- -z "huge table: read from tables of 2B rows with existing DV of many zeros"
```

#### Observed results
