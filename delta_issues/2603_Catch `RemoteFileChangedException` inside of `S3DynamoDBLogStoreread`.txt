## Description
In S3, if `N.json` is over-written while an input stream is open on it, then the ETag will change and a `RemoteFileChangedException` will be thrown.

This PR adds logic to retry reading that `N.json` file, at the exact same line that the error occurred at.

This assumes and requires that the contents of N.json have been overwritten with the same identical content!

As an important implementation highlight: so, if we are at index 25 (thus, the last successfully read index is 24), and we try to call `.next()` on the read iterator, and an RemoteFileChangedException is thrown, we will re-generate the read iterator, skip all the way to index 25, and try reading it again.


## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
