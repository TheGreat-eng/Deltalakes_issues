## Description

This is the second PR in a series of PRs to move the current CommitOwner interface to its own module. PR1 is [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3002).

This PR makes the fields of all CommitOwner-related classes private and forces callers to use getters to access the fields. This is needed in preparation for making the CommitOwner module a Java module (the same as the existing LogStore module) and to follow Java best practices to keep fields private and only allow access through getters.

## How was this patch tested?

Simple refactor so existing tests are sufficient.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
