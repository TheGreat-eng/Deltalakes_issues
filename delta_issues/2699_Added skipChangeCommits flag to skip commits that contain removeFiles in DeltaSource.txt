## Description
Added skipChangeCommits flag to skip commits that contain removeFiles in DeltaSource for structured streaming. The purpose for this change is to replace the current `ignoreChanges` flag that could result in data duplication issues when using Delta as a structured streaming source with DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE INTO operations (e.g. GDPR)

Behavior for existing `ignoreChanges` flag:
- When there's `removeFile` detected in a commit, the `removeFile` would be ignored. And if `addFile` exists as well, the `addFile` would be processed by structured streaming.

Behavior for new `skipChangeCommits` flag:
- When there's `removeFile` detected in a commit, both `removeFile` and `addFile` (if exists) would be ignored by structured streaming to prevent duplication in the sink.

Since a lot of users are using `ignoreChanges` flag today, to not change the expected behavior, I will not modify the existing `ignoreChanges` flag. Instead, I added a new `skipChangeCommits` flag. Once the new `skipChangeCommits` flag is available, we can start deprecating the old `ignoreChanges` and `ignoreDeletes` flag flags.
