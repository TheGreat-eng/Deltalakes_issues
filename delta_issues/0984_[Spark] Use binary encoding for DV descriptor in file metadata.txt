## Description

The Deletion Vector descriptor of each file is currently serialized in file's custom metadata as a JSON string. We can reduce the size of the descriptor by using a custom binary encoding. Note that the serialized DV descriptor is never persisted to disk so this change is safe.

## How was this patch tested?

Updated existing new tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
