## Description
Type widening records type changes applied to a table in the table schema using the following metadata:
```
"metadata": {
  "delta.typeChanges": [{
    "toType": "short",
    "fromType": "byte"
  }]
```
The initial intent was to keep that metadata in schemas returned to users, e.g. via `df.schema`, as it may provide useful information.
That is a bad idea though:
- This allows type widening metadata to leak outside of the table, possibly to other tables. While this isn't expected to cause correctness issues - the type widening metadata is mostly informative - it would still be confusing.
- It is ultimately internal Delta metadata that shouldn't be surfaced to users. Other features, such a column mapping, explicitly remove their related metadata before surfacing schemas to users.

## How was this patch tested?
- Updated existing tests to remove type widening metadata when checking for returned schema.
- Added test to ensure we don't leak type widening metadata

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
Type widening metadata that was visible in dataframe schemas isn't surfaced anymore:
`df.schema`:
Before:
```
"fields": [{
  "name": "a",
  "type": "integer",
  "nullable": true,
  "metadata": {
    "delta.typeChanges": [{
      "toType": "integer",
      "fromType": "short"
    }]
  }
}]
```
After:
```
"fields": [{
  "name": "a",
  "type": "integer",
  "nullable": true,
  "metadata": {}
}]
```
