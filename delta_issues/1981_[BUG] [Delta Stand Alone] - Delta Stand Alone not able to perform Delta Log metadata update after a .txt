## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [ ] Spark
- [X] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem
Not able to make table metadata updates (like adding/ removing/ renaming a column) using delta standalone after a checkpoint is created in AWS S3.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a table using delta stand alone.
2. Perform update table actions delta standalone optimistic transaction method call.
3. Each action will create a new json in the _Delta_log folder of that table.
4. After 10th action, a checkpoint will be created.

5. Hit the same update table action again and it fails to update the delta log and no additional json is created.
6. Table update fails with a null pointer exception, screenshot below

#### Observed results

<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->
Delta Table updates cannot be performed after a checkpoint is created. until the checkpoint creation it worked fine.

Any data append, merge, delete jobs have no impact from this checkpoint (may be since it uses spark to perform data ingestion), only log update thru Delta Stand Alone is failing.

#### Expected results

<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->
Delta Log meta data update should happen as it would before checkpoint creation.

### Environment information
