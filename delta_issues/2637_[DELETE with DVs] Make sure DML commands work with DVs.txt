## Description

This PR adds some tests to make sure that DML commands are able to read Delta tables having DVs. Specifically:

- `UPDATE` and `MERGE` can read DVs, and will re-write a file to materialize DV if rows within are modified.
- `DELETE` can write DVs.

## How was this patch tested?

New tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
