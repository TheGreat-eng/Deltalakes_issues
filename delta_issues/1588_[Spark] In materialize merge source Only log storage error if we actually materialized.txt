## Description

Be more defensive about calling `Option.get` on `materializedSourceRDD` and check first that it's actually `Some`. In fact only invoke the entire branch where we log only when we actually did materialize the source (and not, say, ran out of disk space before).

## How was this patch tested?


This PR adds a new test for the scenario where we throw an out of disk space error without having materialized the source.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
