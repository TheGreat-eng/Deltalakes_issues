When True is the default, the behavior of AC doesn't align with the DBR implementation and results in too frequent compactions being run as minNumFiles isn't respected.

## Description
Aligns behavior of AC with Databricks DBR implementation where it appears this is not enabled (also not exposed as a config option).

## How was this patch tested?
Ran 200 iterations of merging data into a table to confirm the expected behavior of AC in managing small files while respecting the minNumFiles threshold.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No as this session config isn't documented in the Delta.io docs
