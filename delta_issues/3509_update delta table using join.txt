In sql if I want to update a table I do


Update A
set a.col1 = b.col1 
from tablea A join tableb b
on a.id = b.id

This does not work in pyspark SQL for delta tables. I cannot use merge because target has multiple rows matching and merge fails. Please help.

Above code gives below error

Error in SQL statement: ParseException: 
mismatched input 'from' expecting {<EOF>, ';'}(line 3, pos 0)

Pointing to the portion saying " from tablea A join tableb b"
