### Describe the problem

When executing a delta merge operation, if the affected table is read t he lineage of it is affected. So if a DataFrame is checked before and after the merge operation, it can have different values even if cached.

#### Steps to reproduce

<!--
Please include copy-pastable code snippets if possible.

Pyspark code
```
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
from pyspark.sql import DataFrame

print("Start")
table = "MYTABLE"
path = "MYPATH"

schema = StructType([StructField("id", StringType(), True)])

df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [("A",), ("B",), ("C",), ("D",)],
    schema
)

df_del = spark.createDataFrame(
    [("A",), ("B",),("OTHER",)],
    schema
)
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(table)
df_read = spark.read.format("delta").load(path).cache()
df_read.show() # First read


delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(df.sparkSession, path)

delta_table.alias("target").merge(
    source=df_del.alias("source"),
    condition=" AND ".join([f"target.{pk} = source.{pk}" for pk in df_del.columns]),
).whenMatchedDelete().execute()

df_read.show() # Second read. It changed!
```


#### Observed results

<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->
```
+---+
| id|
+---+
|  A|
|  B|
|  C|
|  D|
+---+

TABLE END
+---+
| id|
+---+
|  C|
|  D|
+---+
```


#### Expected results

<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->
```
+---+
| id|
+---+
|  A|
|  B|
|  C|
|  D|
+---+

TABLE END
+---+
| id|
+---+
|  A|
