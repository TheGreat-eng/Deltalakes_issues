## Description
ConcurrentTransactionException did not correctly indicate the problem as it was intended to be used during SetTransaction. By making a new typed error we collect additional information about the conflicting operation in the context of the exception.

## How was this patch tested?
`build/sbt compile && build/sbt test`

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Exceptions will now indicate ConcurrentDomainMetadataException rather than ConcurrentTransactionException with domain info in the string message.
