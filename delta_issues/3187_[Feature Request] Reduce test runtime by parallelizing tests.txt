## Feature request

### Overview

SBT tests currently run sequentially. It would be good to reduce the total test runtime by parallelizing the SBT tests. 

### Motivation

SBT tests are taking longer and longer. This is not scalable. While we have already split various version of Scala tests into two CI builds in the repo, each build takes a long time. This is a burden for local testing as well. Any parallelization without causing test flakiness is going to be help here.

### Further details

Running multiple concurrent SBT tests in the same JVM is likely going to cause major test flakiness. So we have to configure the parallel tests to run in separately JVMs. A quick google search led me to this resource which seems to explain the possibilities pretty well - https://www.yannmoisan.com/sbt-parallel-test.html

A while ago, Apache Spark did something like this as well - https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/9c238b8a462c483644237bd038edcf58f42a7db9
