## Feature request

### Overview
Currently Kernel doesn't have any logging mechanism in the code to trace or debug issues. This issue is to add design and add a logging framework.

### Further details
Contains notes on functionality, implementation, and testing decision questions gathered while building out the Delta Kernel. This is just to keep track of these points and not forget about them.

#### Requirements
* Provide a way to trace the path taken by the Kernel API module for debugging functionality and performance issues.
   * Ex: Log the time before and after the call to get the schema. This helps debug any performance issues with fetching the initial schema.
* Kernel-API module shouldnâ€™t decide where the logs should go. It should be the responsibility of the `TableClient`, but this raises a few questions
  * Where should the Logging API be?
  * How can we generate a per-class Logger just like SLF4J?
  * Or should the Kernel-API depend on SLF4J? 

#### High-level tasks
Depends on solving the above design questions
