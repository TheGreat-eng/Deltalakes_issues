## Description
Iceberg only supports a subset of the type changes that Delta's type widening feature covers.
See https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#schema-evolution.
Unsupported type changes areL
- integers -> decimal
- integers -> double
- decimal scale increase
- date -> timestamp_ntz

This change makes using Uniform with Iceberg compatibility mutually exclusive with using one of these unsupported type changes, e.p.:
- Fail when trying to apply an unsupported type change if Uniform with Iceberg compatibility enabled.
- Fail when trying to enable Uniform with Iceberg compatibility if an unsupported type change was applied in the past.
- Don't automatically widen type during schema evolution if Uniform with Iceberg compatibility is enabled and the type promotion isn't supported by Iceberg.

## How was this patch tested?
- Added suite `TypeWideningUniformSuite` covering all cases listed above. E.p. for schema evolution, covers MERGE and a sample of INSERTs, including streaming writes.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
Note: all the unsupported Iceberg type changes covered here will only be supported in Delta starting with Delta 4.0, so this doesn't impact any released Delta version except for 4.0 preview.

Applying a type change not supported by Iceberg when Uniform with Iceberg compatibility now fails with:
```
CREATE TABLE t (a DECIMAL(10, 2)) TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.enableTypeWidening' = 'true',
  'delta.IcebergCompatV2' = 'true',
  'delta.universalFormat.enabledFormats' = 'iceberg'
);

ALTER TABLE t CHANGE COLUMN a TYPE DECIMAL(12, 4);
[DELTA_ICEBERG_COMPAT_VIOLATION.UNSUPPORTED_TYPE_WIDENING] 
IcebergCompatV2 is incompatible with a type change applied to this table: Field a was changed from DECIMAL(10, 2) to DECIMAL(12, 4)."
```

Enabling Uniform with Iceberg compatibility on a table that had an unsupported type change applied in the past now fails with:
```
CREATE TABLE t (a DECIMAL(10, 2)) TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.enableTypeWidening' = 'true');
ALTER TABLE t CHANGE COLUMN a TYPE DECIMAL(12, 4);


ALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.IcebergCompatV2' = 'true',
  'delta.universalFormat.enabledFormats' = 'iceberg'
);
[DELTA_ICEBERG_COMPAT_VIOLATION.UNSUPPORTED_TYPE_WIDENING] 
IcebergCompatV2 is incompatible with a type change applied to this table: Field a was changed from DECIMAL(10, 2) to DECIMAL(12, 4)."
```

Type changes not supported by Iceberg aren't eligible anymore for automatic type widening with schema evolution in MERGE/INSERT operation when Uniform with Iceberg compatibility is enabled.
