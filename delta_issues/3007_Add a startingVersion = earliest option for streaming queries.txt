## Description

This PR adds an option to start a streaming query on Delta source from earliest version.  
This is different than the default behavior of reading the entire table as it allows to only read incremental changes from that version onward.

For example, assuming a Delta table located in `path` with its earliest version being `n`, a user can now replace this query:
```scala
val n = spark.sql(s"describe history delta.`${path}`").orderBy("version").select("version").first().get(0)
spark.readStream.format("delta").option("startingVersion", n).load(path)
```
with the following query:
```scala
spark.readStream.format("delta").option("startingVersion", "earliest").load(path)
```

## How was this patch tested?

Added unit tests in `DeltaSourceSuite.scala`

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Allowed the option `startingVersion` in `DeltaOptions.scala` to accept the value `earliest`
