## Bug

During write operation in multi cluster write setup, we configured dynamo db to handle concurrent writes.
Delta is creating .tmp folder under _delta_log. 
But this is never getting deleted, I see in the below documentation on how to delete them using AWS s3 api and s3 expiration rules 

Instead it would be Great! if it handled in Delta through VACCUM action.
