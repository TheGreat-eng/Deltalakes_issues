This PR adds CDF to the UPDATE command, during which we generate both preimage and postimage CDF data.

This PR also adds UpdateCDCSuite which adds basic tests for these CDF changes.

As a high-level overview of how this CDF-update operation is performed, when we find a row that satisfies the update condition, we `explode` an array containing the pre-image, post-image, and main-table updated rows.

The pre-image and post-image rows are appropriately typed with the corresponding CDF_TYPE, and the main-table updated row has CDF_TYPE `null`. Thus, the first two rows will be written to the cdf parquet file, with the latter is written to standard main-table data parquet file.
