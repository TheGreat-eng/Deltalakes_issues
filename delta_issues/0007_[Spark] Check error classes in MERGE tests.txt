## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Update MERGE tests to use `checkError` instead of inspecting error messages.
Also cleans up error `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_DELTA_0011`, a catch all that serves no purpose and hides information, failures to resolve the MERGE plan will anyway result in a proper error message.

## How was this patch tested?
Updated tests.
