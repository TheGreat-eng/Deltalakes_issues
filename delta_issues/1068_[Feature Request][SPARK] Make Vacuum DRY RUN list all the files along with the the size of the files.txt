### Overview
As of now, Vacuum dry run mode returns a dataframe containing a list of first 1000 files to be deleted. Instead, it's more useful to return all the eligible files to be deleted along with the size of these files.


### Motivation
 Today, users run Vacuum in dry run mode to understand the eligible files and the size of the data that is going to be deleted. By returning only a sample of 1000 files, users are not able to achieve their objective.
