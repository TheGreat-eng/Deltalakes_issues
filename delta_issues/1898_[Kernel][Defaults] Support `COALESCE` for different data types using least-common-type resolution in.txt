### Overview

#2415 adds support for `COALESCE` for boolean type expressions and #2416 is to add support for all data types (needs to be finished before this issue). This issue is to support different `expr` data types if they can all be up-casted to one least-common-type.

### Further details

Need to update `DefaultExpressionEvaluator` to find a least-common-type if it exists and add implicit casts for each expression.
