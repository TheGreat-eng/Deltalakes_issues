Adding support for Google Cloud Storage(GCS) as Delta Storage by introducing GcsLogStore.

This PR addresses [issue #294][1]. File creation is an all-or-nothing approach to achieve atomicity and uses Gcs [preconditions][2] to avoid race conditions among multiple writers/drivers. This implementation relies on gcs-connector to provide necessary `FileSystem` implementations. This has been tested on a Google Dataproc cluster. 

#### GcsLogStore requirements

1. spark.delta.logStore.class=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.storage.GcsLogStore 
2. Include gcs-connector in classpath. The Cloud Storage connector is automatically installed on Dataproc clusters.

#### Usage

```
TABLE_LOCATION = 'gs://ranuvikram-test/test/delta-table'

# Write data to table.
data = spark.range(5, 10)
data.write.format("delta").mode("append").save(TABLE_LOCATION)

# Read data from table.
df = spark.read.format("delta").load(TABLE_LOCATION)
df.show()
```
