I noticed that new `DeltaTableBuilder` API for scala is not as user-friendly as itself for Python when I tried to use generated columns as users need to explicitly write `DeltaTable.columnBuilder` inside `addColumn`.
I would like to have `expr` and `comment` augments and make them (and `nullable`) have default parameters as below so that `DeltaTableBuilder` API for Scala can be used as easily as Python one.
```
addColumn(colName: String, dataType: DataType,Â nullable: Boolean = True,
expr: Option[String] = None, comment: Option[String] = None): DeltaTableBuilder = {
    addColumn(
        DeltaTable.columnBuilder(spark, colName).dataType(dataType)
        .nullable(nullable).generatedAlwaysAs(expr).comment(comment).build
    )
    this
}
```
We also need to change other functions such as `generatedAlwaysAs` a bit to adapt them for this change.

I believe this change will also reduce the lines of code by combining `addColumn(colName: String, dataType: DataType)` and `addColumn(colName: String, dataType: DataType, nullable Boolean)` together.
