## Description

This PR introduces `CollatedPredicate` as a new type of `Predicate` for comparing strings in collated fashion. The `DefaultEngine` will only support the default collation (SPARK.UTF8_BINARY), meaning `ExpressionHandler` should be implemented for using any other collation.

## How was this patch tested?

Tests added to `CollatedPredicateSuite` and `DefaultExpressionEvaluatorSuite`.
Tests for file pruning will be added in the next PR, as modifying `DataSkippingPredicate` is required.
Currently, `DataSkippingPredicate` is just a regular `Predicate`, but it needs to be updated to also include information about collation.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
