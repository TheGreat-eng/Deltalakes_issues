## Feature Request - Suggestion - Performance Fix

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
this applies to projects using HadoopFileSystemLogStore

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone

I have already tested my proposal on the autonomous Delta project.
And for me, these improvements reduce the transaction time from about 50-60 seconds to 10-18 (at the start) seconds. Too much time is wasted on calls to FileSystem.listStatus.

### Overview

Suggest! explicitly use the s3 api for listFrom targets - there are excellent s3api listObjectsV2 and ListObjectsV2Request.withPrefix
and thanks to the ordered structure of the log table, this can be implemented as efficiently as possible!

We can quickly request only the necessary information from the table!

Now FileSystem.listStatus is used for this, i.e. we get the full list of files from the delta log on each listFrom call  - and this takes a lot of time, even if the log is small!

### Motivation

It should be cool improvements 

### Willingness to contribute

The Delta Lake Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature?

- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the Delta Lake community.
