### Overview

Implement bucketing in Delta lake to speed up aggregation and join cases. 
<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

### Motivation
Currently, I found that Delta Lake[ doesnâ€™t support bucketing](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/524). This leads to inefficiency for two kinds of use cases: 

- Reduce operation on bucketing columns. If we can have a delta table bucketed by a list of columns, then any aggregation operation on those columns can be speeded up. Without bucketing information, Spark will incur an expensive shuffle operation. 
- Join two tables bucketed in the same way. If we want to join two tables and those two tables are bucketed in the same way, spark can plan it as a MergeSortJoin. Otherwise, an expensive shuffle is needed.  


The bucketing was proposed in spark to solve the above problems (see original[ JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12394) and[ design](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778890/BucketedTables.pdf)), so spark has supported bucketing for several years. However, the delta lake does not support bucketing. 
Delta lake has developed features [Z-ordering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TYFxAUvhtYqQ6IHAZXjliVuitA5D1u793PMnzsH_3vs/edit#heading=h.q7ah6pca24ul) and [liquid clustering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWR3odjOw4v4-hjFy_hVaNdxHVs4WuK1asfB6M6XEMw/edit#heading=h.skpz7c7ga1wl), but both features are for data skipping, so both features cannot help avoiding unnecessary shuffles in aggregation & joins.
