## Description
`RowTrackingBackfill` (or backfill for short) is a special operation that materializes and recommits all existing files in table using one or several commits to ensure that every AddFile has a base row ID and default Row Commit Version.

In this PR, we add a new rule to `ConflictChecker` that resolve concurrent conflicts involving Backfill. We check that RowTrackingBackfill is not resurrecting files that were removed concurrently and that an AddFile and its corresponding RemoveFile have the same base row ID and default RCV. We also add logic to skip certain concurrency checks if it involves Backfill.

This opens up a lot of interesting Conflict Resolutions cases to test, so we will add more UTs revolving conflict checking/resolutions between Backfill and other operations with different scenario in the next PRs.
