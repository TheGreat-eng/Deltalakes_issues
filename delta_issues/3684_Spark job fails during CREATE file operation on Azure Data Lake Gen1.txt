Hi, 

I am facing an issue in executing the Spark job with the below details.  

Spark Version:  3.0.0

Please help and let me know 
1. What is the root cause of the issue ?
2. How to fix it ?  Is this something to do with the size of ADL Gen1 file system. 


**Brief Overview**
Our Big Data Product runs in AKS Cluster deployed in Microsoft Azure. 

All the jobs executed within the product are Apache Spark jobs. In addition to HDFS, even Azure Data Lake Gen1 is also one of the supported file systems. 

**Scenario**
Source generates events and publishes them into Azure Event Hubs.  Spark Streaming job is waiting for events on a particular EH(Event Hub) and it will keep on writing the data into Azure Data Lake Gen1 file system. 

- Huge number of transactions (1 to 5 million) records have been injected at the source side 
- Spark streaming job is continuously running for hours and writing the data into the ADL Gen1 file system 
- All of a sudden, it fails in the middle with the below error:
