## Description

Adds mocked unit tests for the log segment construction code.

Items to address
1) [P0] For some of the _valid file listings_ the error messages are confusing / misleading. We should fix these.
2) [P2] Behavior for _corrupt file listings_ is sporadic and inconsistent and error messages are confusing. We should consider fixing these at some point.
3) [P2] The log segment building code is really confusing. I think completely re-doing this has been discussed (?) at some point but is low priority. I'm planning to revisit this PR and see what low-effort improvements I can make for readability (max 15-20 minutes.)
