Delta already implements `Vacuum` command for data path garbage collection in the latest version, but I can't find any collection mechanism for log path (default value is `_delta_log`).
otherwise, the delta log file will grow fast in an append Structured Streaming program.
I think is a batter idea to collect these log file when we run `Vaccum` command.
