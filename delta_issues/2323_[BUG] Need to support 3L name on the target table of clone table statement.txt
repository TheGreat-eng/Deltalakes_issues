## Bug
As mentioned in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1985#discussion_r1298883598,  the target table of `CloneTableStatement` doesn't support catalog field since it is created as
```
val targetRelation = UnresolvedRelation(target)
```
and the apply method will ignore the catalog field:
```
  def apply(tableIdentifier: TableIdentifier): UnresolvedRelation =
    UnresolvedRelation(tableIdentifier.database.toSeq :+ tableIdentifier.table)
```
