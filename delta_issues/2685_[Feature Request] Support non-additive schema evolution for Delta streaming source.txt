## Feature request

### Overview

We released [column mapping](https://docs.delta.io/latest/versioning.html#-column-mapping) for Delta, which adds a mapping layer on how columns are written to Parquet files physically, and displayed to users logically. This enabled use cases on Delta, such as column renaming and dropping. However, we noticed that column renaming and dropping may lead to available data not being propagated downstream in the right manner with streaming workloads. For this reason, streaming on column mapping table with these non-additive schema changes have been blocked in the past.

To fix this, we propose to allow Delta streaming source to create microbatches that correspond exactly to the data schema at the time when the data is generated. In the way, as the stream progresses, the schema changes can be propagated downstream dynamically and user can reliably leverage this to make conscious decisions on what to do for downstream tables.

### Motivation

This would enable a wide range of streaming use cases for Delta table with column mapping:
1. Streaming workload with non-additive schema changes won't be blocked like it is today!
2. Data replication under SCD type 2 can be achieved because downstream table can track all the schema changes from the source table without data loss
3. Materialized view can be simulated by streaming Delta CDC data and capture the exact schema changes.

### Further details

Please see more details in this [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UPgJRo48EUVk72x5Qx66b1uknNMBV_-jD-YDixYRCdA/edit#).
