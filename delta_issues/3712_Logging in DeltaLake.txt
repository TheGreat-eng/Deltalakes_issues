I am running Delta Lake in standalone mode and want to enable DeltaLogging - (https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/metering/DeltaLogging.scala) but I am having trouble enabling this. It might be that this Databricks logging which is a premium feature and cannot be accessed in the open source feature. ( https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/audit-logs.html ) I was unable to find documentation to confirm this though. Is my assumption that deltalogging can accessed only through premium feature correct?
