## Description

This PR improves the FILE_PATH canonicalization logic by avoiding calling expensive `Path.toUri.toString` calls for each row in a table. Canonicalized paths are now cached and the UDF just needs to look it up.

Future improvement is possible for handling huge logs: build `canonicalizedPathMap` in a distributed way.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests.
