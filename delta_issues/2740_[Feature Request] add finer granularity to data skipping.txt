## Feature request
Add more granularity to data skipping 
### Overview

I know that each commit, min/max values are calculated for each parquet file and are present in the delta log json, but how about adding more granularity to existing data skipping mechanism, by using parquet page skipping?
Relevant links:

https://blog.cloudera.com/speeding-up-select-queries-with-parquet-page-indexes/
Would this be doable?
