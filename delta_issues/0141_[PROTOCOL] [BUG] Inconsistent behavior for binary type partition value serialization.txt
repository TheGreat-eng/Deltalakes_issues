## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
- [X] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [X] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem
[PROTOCOL](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#partition-value-serialization) says: `Encoded as a string of escaped binary values. For example, "\u0001\u0002\u0003"`

This is not happening for values that can be represented by string:

INSERT INTO TestBinary VALUES (10, X'123456'); -- OK

INSERT INTO TestBinary VALUES (10, CAST('Hello' as BINARY)); // NOT OK
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6d4099f-16e5-42b2-8332-0df85eac2106)

#### Steps to reproduce
CREATE TABLE TestBinary (id INT, value BINARY) PARTITIONED BY (value);
INSERT INTO TestBinary VALUES (10, CAST('Hello' as BINARY));
INSERT INTO TestBinary VALUES (10, X'123456');

#### Observed results
Hello

#### Expected results
\u0048\u0065\u006c\u006c\u006f
