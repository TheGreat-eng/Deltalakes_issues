## Description

- Introduces the row_index column to StructField. For now, we indicate a metadata column in the field metadata with `{"isMetadataColumn" : "true"}`.

- Updates `ParquetBatchReader` to track any file row index columns using [ParquetReader.getCurrentIndex()](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.parquet/parquet-hadoop/1.12.3/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/ParquetReader.html#getCurrentRowIndex()). 

## How was this patch tested?

Adds a test to TestParquetBatchReader. Existing tests check for scenario when the row_index column is not requested.
