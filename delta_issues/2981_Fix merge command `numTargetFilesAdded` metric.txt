## Description

This PR fixes a bug in `MergeIntoCommand` where the metric `numTargetFilesAdded` sometimes gave an unexpected value. This PR ensures that `MergeIntoCommand` only writes out new files to the target table that are non-empty (i.e. at least 1 row).

Note: the value was never wrong, for example it would say that we wrote out 1 file, and we did in fact write out 1 empty file. However, there was no logical reason for us to write out an empty file with no rows.

This PR also updates existing tests (which knew about this bug and so were ignored) inside of `MergeIntoMetricsBase`.
