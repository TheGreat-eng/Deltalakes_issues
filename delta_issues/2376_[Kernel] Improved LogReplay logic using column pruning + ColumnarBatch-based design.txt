## Description

This PR updates the core LogReplay logic that delta-kernel-api implements.

Previously, `LogReplay::getAddFiles` and `LogReplay::loadTableProtocolAndMetadata` would fully deserialize each row of JSON into a Delta action, and then perform some logic or algorithm with that Action.

Now, log replay uses a helper class `ActionsIterator` that takes in a read schema (e.g. AddFiles and RemoveFiles) and returns a iterator of ColumnarBatch of that specified schema. It is up to the consumer of that iterator of ColumnarBatch to deserialize whichever rows or specific columns that they need.

This PR also updates the core "read Add and Remove files to determine the active files of the table" logic. It is documented clearly in the class `ActiveAddFilesIterator`, please take a look.

## How was this patch tested?

Trivial sanity check test end-to-end test that reads the protocol and metadata and some rows.
