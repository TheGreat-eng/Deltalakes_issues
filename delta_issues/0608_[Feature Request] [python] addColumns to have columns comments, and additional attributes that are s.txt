### Overview

The method is missing feasibility to add multiple columns, same way we add individual columns.

### Motivation

The feature will be used to create external tables to add multiple columns with all the fields supported by individual column method,
This would not differentiate between the 2 add methods.

### Further details

I believe we need to have a column dictionary that would be supported by the delta table, and use this dictionary as an input for both methods.
