## Are fast parallel writes in Delta Tables on S3 possible?

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [ ] Kernel
- [x] Other (Spark Connect)

### Overview

I have set up a Spark Connect kubernetes cluster (Spark v3.5.0) that reads from and writes to a set of Delta Tables (using Delta 3.0.0). I am using AWS S3 as storage, AWS Glue as metastore, and have configured S3DynamoDBLogStore for concurrent writes.

I have also carefully partitioned the tables, and I'm trying to operate concurrently and in parallel for different partitions. The problem is that I see the performance of the system degrade very quickly (in terms of Spark computations) as the parallel requests increase in number. 

If one job alone requires 2 minutes to complete, two jobs slow down to 3 minutes, 10 jobs slow down to 15-18 minutes, even though the Spark cluster utilization is quite low. Increasing resources/executors does virtually nothing. 

I believe the slowdown is due to the locking mechanism of the delta tables. 

I even tried the S3SingleDriverLogStore but no improvements.

I also tried disabling the snapshotCache (setting spark.databricks.delta.snapshotCache.storageLevel to NONE) to no avail.

### Question

Are fast parallel writes in Delta Tables possible at all on S3? Are there other configurations that I can explore that could help me in my quest?
