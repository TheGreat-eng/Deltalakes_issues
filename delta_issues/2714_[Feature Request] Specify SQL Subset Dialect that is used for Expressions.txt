## Feature request

### Overview

As Delta is just a storage format and is actually not tied directly to Spark, the spec (Protocol.md) should mention what dialect and subset is ok. I guess it should be mostly ANSI SQL if possible

### Motivation

The spec should be clear so that different implementations do it in the same way. Otherwise we end up with delta files which can only be read by a particular implementation

### Further details

At least the following needs to be answered:

- How is quoting a column supposed to work? I guess it should be ANSI-style: "column with space"
- Which functions are allowed?
- Which operators are allowed?
- Which SQL Expressions are allowed? `AND`/`OR`/`CASE WHEN` ?
