We want to have the thinnest, most-lightweight read schema during LogReplay (parsing AddFiles and RemoveFiles, to yield the active add files in the table).

Thus, we should only read the AddFile statistics field when
1) there exists a query filter, and
2) the connector is able to evaluate the stats-min/max etc. query (used to perform data skipping for that input query filter)

If either of 1 or 2 is false, then we should skip reading the add file stats column during LogReplay json/checkpoint parsing.
