## Description

Adds support for `DecimalType`.

- Adds the `getDecimal` API to `ColumnVector` and `Row`
- Reading decimals from parquet (in the default parquet reader)
- Reading decimal partition columns
- Creating decimal type literals, and evaluating them in the default `ExpressionHandler`

- Also refactors some test utilities to `TestUtils` and updates `DeletionVectorSuite` accordingly

### Some details

1) We add the `getDecimal` API to `ColumnVector`. Connector implementations of a decimal `ColumnVector`s are welcome to add and use their own decimal API in their implementation.
2) In the default parquet reader, for now we materialize decimals in memory as java `BigDecimals` in `DefaultDecimalVector` since performance is not our main goal. We can revisit this later and back int/long decimals with primitive arrays (and store the precison/scale separately). We would still implement the `getDecimal` API so this can be optimized later.

## How was this patch tested?

Adds test tables to `GoldenTables`. Adds end-to-end tests and some specific tests for the parquet reader.
