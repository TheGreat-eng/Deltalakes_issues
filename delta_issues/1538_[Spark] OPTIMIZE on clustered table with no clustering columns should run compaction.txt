Currently, when running OPTIMIZE on a clustered table without any clustering columns(after ALTER TABLE CLUSTER BY NONE), it would fail with a long stack trace:
```

This change makes OPTIMIZE on a clustered table without any clustering columns run regular compaction, which is the desired behavior.
## How was this patch tested?

<!--
If tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to test the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.
If the changes were tested in any way other than unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step (ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future).
If the changes were not tested, please explain why.
-->
This change adds a new test to verify the correct behavior. The test would fail without the fix.
## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

<!--
If yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.
If possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.
If no, write 'No'.

No.
