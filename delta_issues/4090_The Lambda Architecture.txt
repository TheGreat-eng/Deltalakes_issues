Hi,
I have seen some videos about Delta.
Many of them are talking about the Lambda Architecture (The need of both batch processing and streaming processing of the same data).

After explaining the problems with this architecture, there is a proposal to use only spark streaming, and streaming it to a Delta table.

Why can't I do it without Delta?
 
I mean that Delta does not solve the problem of loosing data in stream and therefore using batch to fill up missing data.
