## Feature request

### Overview

Currently when we creates a Delta table in Hive Metastore using different systems, we will store different formats in Hive Metastore. This causes the following issue:

- After create a Delta table in Hive Metastore using Spark, this table can only be accessed by Spark. For example, using Hive to access this table will fail.
- After create a Delta table in Hive Metastore using Hive, this table can only be accessed by Hive. Using Spark to access this table will fail.

Similar issues happen in Presto and Flink as well. It would be great if we can define a unified format in Hive Metastore for Delta.

### Motivation

If we define a unifed format in Hive Metastore, and all of systems (Spark, Hive, Presto, Flink) use the same format, then no matter how a table is created, it can be accessed by all of systems.
