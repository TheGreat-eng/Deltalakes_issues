## Description

Extend the remove actions with statistics about the data in the file that is being removed from the table and that can be used to optimize queries that read the changes of older versions, e.g., Change Data Feed queries. These statistics are copied from the add action when a file is being removed.

File statistics can be large and increase the size of checkpoints. However, statistics of remove actions are not needed for tombstones but only for Delta JSON files, and so are dropped from checkpoints.

## How was this patch tested?

- Extended existing tests for JSON (de-)serialization
- Existing tests provide coverage regarding the fields that are stored in checkpoints.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
