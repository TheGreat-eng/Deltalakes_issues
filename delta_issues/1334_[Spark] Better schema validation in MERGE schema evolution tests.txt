## Description
Address following shortcomings of schema evolution tests in MERGE:
- Tests ignore the nullability of fields when validating the schema of the table after evolution, which prevents checking for nullability of specific fields.

- For struct evolution tests, a result schema can be passed but this schema is only used to parse the result data and not to validate the schema of the table after evolution.
