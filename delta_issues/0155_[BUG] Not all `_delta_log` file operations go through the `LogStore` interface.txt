### Describe the problem

While trying to implement a custom [LogStore](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/storage/src/main/java/io/delta/storage/LogStore.java#L57) I realized that not all operations accessing files in the `_delta_log` directory go through the store.

Specifically, reads of the delta log entries, `<version>.json` don't use the `LogStore` at all and instead are read directly using the Hadoop Filesystem ([see an example here in the `Snapshot` code](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/Snapshot.scala#L443-L454)). I assume this is because we want to read the delta log entries in parallel.

**Question:** is this the intended behavior of `LogStore`, or is it a bug? I need to extend a bit how we access the delta log and wondering whether I should just do this at the Filesystem layer.

#### Steps to reproduce

I reproduced this by doing the following:

1. Create a pass-through `LogStore` implementation
2. Set `spark.delta.logStore.class` to the classname of my custom `LogStore`
3. Set checkpoints on all methods of `LogStore` to find out when each file is accessed

#### Observed results

Some files are read using the `LogStore`, like the checkpoing `<version>.crc` files, but not the `<version>.json` files.

#### Expected results

Expected all files in `_delta_log` to be read from the `LogStore`.
