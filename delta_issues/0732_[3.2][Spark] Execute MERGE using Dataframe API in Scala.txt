(cherrypick of #3456)

Due to Spark unfortunate behavior of resolving plan nodes it doesn't know, the `DeltaMergeInto` plan created when using the MERGE scala API needs to be manually resolved to ensure spark doesn't interfere with its analysis.

This currently completely bypasses Spark's analysis as we then manually execute the MERGE command which has negatiev effects, e.g. the execution is not visible in QueryExecutionListener.

This change addresses this issue, by executing the plan using the Dataframe API after it's manually resolved so that the command goes through the regular code path.
