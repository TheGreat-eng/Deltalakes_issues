Hey all, I was curious is there is a way to parallelize the Deltatable object. 

I tried the Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(function () for i in list_) but came across : Type error: cannot unpack non-iterable DeltaTable object. 

I want to perform this on Databricks, where I want to basically optimize on my table like 
`deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, table_name)
deltaTable.optimize().executeCompaction()
`
Since this would be performed on a huge number of table, looking for ways how I could parallelize it on databricks..Any suggestions would be helpful. :)
