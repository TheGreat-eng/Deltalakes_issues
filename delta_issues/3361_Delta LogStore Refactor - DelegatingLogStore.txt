Refactor [DelegatingLogStore](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/storage/DelegatingLogStore.scala) to Java for the new delta-storage artifact.

For the test, you should be able to make `DelegatingLogStoreSuite` be an abstract class (`DelegatingLogStoreSuiteBase`) and create both Internal and Public child implementations.

Each child could implement a method to instantiate the right LogStore, e.g. to replace the `new DelegatingLogStore()` call inside of `testDelegatingLogStore`.

A similar example to this is [LineCloseableIteratorSuite](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/storage/LineClosableIteratorSuite.scala)
