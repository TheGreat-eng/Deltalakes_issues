## Feature request

When a feature with the name `delta.feature.<feature>` is passed in the [TableProperties](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/TransactionBuilder.java#L84C22-L84C41) map, it should be added to a protocol action and removed from the map (which gets stored as metadata).

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?


- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [x] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview

Today, there are some features that Kernel cannot properly set on the protocol.  Being able to pass these through TableProperties and have them set in Reader/Writer features for table is needed to be able to modify table level features.

### Motivation

See overview

### Further details

Rough steps:

1. look at given properties and see if it any of them is prefixed with delta.feature
2. extract the features out of these properties
3. remove these properties from metadata that we are going to update
4. update the protocol with these new features.
