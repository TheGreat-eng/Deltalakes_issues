The CDC's `_commit_timestamp` is incorrect when we try to read/display it under a different Spark Session's timezone `spark.sql.session.timeZone` (e.g. `America/Chicago`, `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`, ...). 

In this PR, we address this issue by taking into account timezone to capture the precise point in time when we convert `CDCDataSpec`'s [Java Timestamp](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/cdc/CDCReader.scala#L173) field to [Spark's Timestamp](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/cdc/CDCReader.scala#L80) for the `_commit_timestamp` column for all CDC's file indexes (`CDCAddFileIndex`, `TahoeRemoveFileIndex`, `TahoeChangeFileIndex`).

This is needed in order for CDF to work properly under a different timezone than `UTC`.

## How was this patch tested?
Added UT, some minor UTs fix to take into account timezone.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
Yes.

- CDC's `_commit_timestamp` should now be correct when we try to read/display it under a different Spark Session's timezone `spark.sql.session.timeZone` (e.g.` America/Chicago`, `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`, ...).
- This is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions and within the unreleased branches such as master.

<!--
If yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.
If possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.
If no, write 'No'.
