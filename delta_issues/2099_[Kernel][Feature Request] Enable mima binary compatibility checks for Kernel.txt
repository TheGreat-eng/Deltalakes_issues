### Overview

We have mima checks for Spark, Standalone, and Flink, we should add them for Kernel before the next release.

The checks need to be enabled for the `kernelApi` and `kernelDefaults` projects in `build.sbt`. The MiMa settings for other projects are in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/project/Mima.scala, we can mimic this for the kernel projects.
