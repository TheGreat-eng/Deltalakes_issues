Hi, this is a feature request to support user designated location of the _delta_log folder. While it is possible to create an external table from the parquet files alone; something like Snowflake/Azure Data Warehouse is not able to understand what the _delta_log folder is an errors out when making an external table. Would it be possible to support the ability to designate the save location of the _delta_logs so that these tools can read the folder while still being able to take advantage of Delta? I understand this would complicate the read, as you would need to pass both the parquet location and the _delta_log folder, but would it be better to be explicit rather than implicit here? 

Maybe make the implicit way the default and allow the user the option to  explicitly store these elsewhere?
