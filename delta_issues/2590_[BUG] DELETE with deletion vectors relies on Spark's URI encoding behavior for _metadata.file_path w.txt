In Spark 3.3 and below `_metadata.file_path` does URI encoding (spaces are encoded as `%20`).
In Spark 3.4.0 `_metadata.file_path` is not encoded.

DELETE with deletion vectors (#1591) [expects](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/DeleteWithDeletionVectorsHelper.scala#L296) a specific behavior and won't work for both.

If this regression is patched in 3.4.1 or newer we need to handle the different behaviors. I.e. generate our own path metadata column in `DeltaParquetFileFormat`. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43284 tracks fixing the regression in 3.4.0.
