## Protocol Change Request

### Description of the protocol change

The proposed protocol change adds a small extension to the Column Mapping feature. It tracks whether a column name has been dropped or renamed during the history of the table. This allows using the (logical) name of a column as the physical name of a column, while still ensuring that all physical names are unique. This helps with the disablement of Column Mapping proposed in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2481, as in this case it is no longer required to rewrite the table, and it simply suffices to change the mode to none.
