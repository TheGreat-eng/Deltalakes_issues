## Description

This PR extends the existing benchmarks with new test cases dedicated to the MERGE INTO command, with two scale factors: 1GB & 3TB.
The following type of test cases are created and can be extended in the future:
- `SingleInsertOnlyTestCase`
- `MultipleInsertOnlyTestCase`
- `DeleteOnlyTestCase`
- `UpsertTestCase`

Each test case uses the same (cloned) target table and defines its source table using the following parameters:
- `fileMatchedFraction`: The fraction of target files sampled to create the source table.
- `rowMatchedFraction: The fraction of rows sampled in each selected target file to form the rows that match the `ON` condition.
- `rowNotMatchedFraction`: The fraction of rows sampled in each selected target file to form the rows that don't match the `ON` condition.

The target and source tables are created using the `merge-1gb-delta-load`/`merge-3tb-delta-load`, which collect all the source table configurations used in merge test cases and creates the required source tables.

## How was this patch tested?

This benchmark is added to measure the impact of a series of changes to the merge command, see https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1827

I followed the instructions in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/benchmarks to create an EMR cluster and run the new benchmarks. Here are the result comparing the impact of https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1827:
