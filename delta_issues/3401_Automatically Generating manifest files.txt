I am trying to query Delta tables from presto. I am able to create the manifest files using the deltaTable.generate(“symlink_format_manifest”)
However, when I try to enable the automatic manifest files generation by setting table property “delta.compatibility.symlinkFormatManifest.enabled=true”, the manifest files aren’t created automatically on every insert.  My write volumes are very low, it's just for a POC. Please let me know how we can enable automatic manifest files generation. I have referenced the blog https://docs.delta.io/latest/presto-integration.html#language-python
