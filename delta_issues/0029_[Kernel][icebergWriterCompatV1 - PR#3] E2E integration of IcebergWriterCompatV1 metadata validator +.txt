## Description

Parent issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/4289

Integrates the `IcebergWriterCompatV1MetadataValidatorAndUpdater` added in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4291 to the transaction write path. This means after this PR when writing to a table with `IcebergWriterCompatV1` enabled, or when enabling `IcebergWriterCompatV1` we will perform the necessary metadata validations and updates.

We currently limit this feature to only be enabled on new tables.

## How was this patch tested?

`IcebergWriterCompatV1MetadataValidatorAndUpdater` is already thoroughly tested in `IcebergWriterCompatV1MetadataValidatorAndUpdaterSuite` but we also add an E2E test suite that tests all the validation  & use cases (& covers the protocol upgrades for this feature).


## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, after all tasks in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/4289 are complete a new writer feature will be supported.
