## Description

During commit we validate that `AddFile` actions cannot contain Deletion Vectors when DVs are not enabled for a table (table property). This restriction is incorrect for actions that update metadata of existing files, e.g. `ComputeStatistics` or `RowTrackingBackfill`. The current code skips the check for `ComputeStatistics` operation but not for other operations that perform in-place-metadata updates. The new `isInPlaceFileMetadataUpdate` method is added to Delta operations so that we can easily distinguish such operations. 

The `getAssertDeletionVectorWellFormedFunc` function is slightly refactor to be more readable.
