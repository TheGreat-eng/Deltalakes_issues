## Description

Update Delta log protocol to support column default values.

This will support column default values for Delta Lake tables.
Users should be able to associate default values with Delta Lake columns at table creation time or thereafter.

Support for column defaults is a key requirement to facilitate updating the  table schema over time and performing  DML operations on wide tables with sparse data.
