## Description

This PR add supports for Delta tables in `delta-spark` with Unity Catalog (UC) as the Commit Coordinator. This feature enables UC to act as the commit coordinator for Delta tables, providing atomic commit operations and seamless integration between Delta tables and Unity Catalog. The system will use UC as the commit coordinator when `delta.coordinatedCommits.commitCoordinator{-preview}` is set to `unity-catalog` in the Delta table properties.

UC will maintain table metadata and track unbackfilled commits. UC will also ensure atomic commits and handle commit conflicts.
