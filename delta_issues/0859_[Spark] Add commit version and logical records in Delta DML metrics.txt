## Description

Extend `delta.dml.{merge, update, delete}.stats` metrics with the following fields:
- `commitVersion` The commit version of the DML version. This allows associating DML metrics with commit metrics and distinguishing DML operations that did not commit.
- `numLogicalRecordsAdded` and `numLogicalRecordsRemoved`: The number of logical records in AddFile and RemoveFile actions to be committed. These metrics can be compared to the row-level metrics emitted by the DML operations.

Finally, this commit adds the `isWriteCommand` field in DELETE metrics to distinguish DELETE operations that are performed in the context of WRITE commands that selectively overwrite data.
