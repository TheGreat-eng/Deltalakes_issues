## Feature request
Currently Kernel relies on the `_last_checkpoint` metadata file for finding the last checkpoint before a given version. If it is missing or greater than eh version we are searching for, [it lists all commit and checkpoint files in the `_delta_log`](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/internal/snapshot/SnapshotManager.java#L363) to find the latest checkpoint. This is not efficient as the listing takes time. Instead, follow the `delta-spark` method of going back to the last 1000 commit files from the version we are trying to load and find a checkpoint from that list. If not found, go by another 1000 commit files further back. Repeat until a checkpoint is found or 0th commit is reached.
