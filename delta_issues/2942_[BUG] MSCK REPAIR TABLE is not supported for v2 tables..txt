## Bug
MSCK REPAIR TABLE command doesn't seem to work with Delta Lake >= 2.0.0 despite being mentioned in [docs](https://docs.delta.io/latest/presto-integration.html#step-2-configure-presto-trino-or-athena-to-read-the-generated-manifests) 

### Describe the problem
Originally I came across this issue using EMR + Athena but it's reproducible on local as well. The point is that invoking
```python
spark.sql("MSCK REPAIR TABLE test.table")
```
throws 
```python
pyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: MSCK REPAIR TABLE is not supported for v2 tables.
```
Despite being referenced in docs:
> If the Delta table is partitioned, run MSCK REPAIR TABLE mytable after generating the manifests to force the metastore (connected to Presto, Trino, or Athena) to discover the partitions.

#### Steps to reproduce

pyspark --packages io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.0.0 --conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog" --driver-memory=12g --conf "spark.sql.warehouse.dir=/Users/mateusz/Desktop/tmp123/spark_warehouse"
```python
import pyspark.sql.functions as f
spark.sql("create database test")
(
    spark.range(1, 10)
    .withColumn("part", f.col("id") % 2)
    .write
    .partitionBy("part")
    .option("overwriteSchema", "true")
    .mode("overwrite")
    .format("delta")
    .saveAsTable("test.table")
)
```
```python
spark.sql("MSCK REPAIR TABLE test.table")
```

#### Observed results

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/libexec/python/pyspark/sql/session.py", line 723, in sql

#### Expected results

<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->

I'd like the table to be querable by Athena as defined [here](https://docs.delta.io/latest/presto-integration.html#step-2-configure-presto-trino-or-athena-to-read-the-generated-manifests)
