## Description
Various refactorings which reduce the code by 1000+ lines.
* Change the `Scan.getScanFiles()` to return `FilteredColumnarBatch` instead of `ColumnarBatch`. The former has an additional selection vector which avoids rewriting the `ColumnarBatch`es generated by the readers of Delta log commit/checkpoint files. Before this change, there was a rewriting of `ColumnarBatch`es in `kernel-api` module.
* Remove the POJO based `ColumnarBatch` and `Row`. They are no longer needed.
* Create a `ScanFile` API class that contains the schema of the scan file rows returned by `Scan.getScanFiles`
  * Create an extension `InternalScanFile` for utility methods that are internal only to `kernel-api` module. 
* Clean up the `ScanStateRow` (move related APIs from `Utils.java` to `ScanStateRow.java`)
* Remove unneeded `Action` classes
