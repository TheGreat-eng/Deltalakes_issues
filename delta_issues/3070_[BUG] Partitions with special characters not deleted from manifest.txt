## Bug

### Describe the problem

The `generate("symlink_format_manifest")` does not properly delete outdated manifest files that have special characters in partition names.

#### Steps to reproduce

In spark-shell:

```scala
import io.delta.tables.DeltaTable

val df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq(("foo bar", "baz"))).toDF("myPartition", "value")
df.write.format("delta").partitionBy("myPartition").save("/tmp/delta-table")
val dt = DeltaTable.forPath("/tmp/delta-table")
dt.generate("symlink_format_manifest")

dt.update(col("myPartition") === "foo bar", Map("myPartition" -> lit("baz bax")))
dt.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
```

#### Observed results

The contents of /tmp/delta-table/_symlink_format_manifest will then be:

```
.
├── myPartition=baz bax
│  └── manifest
└── myPartition=foo bar
   └── manifest
```

#### Expected results

The old `myPartition=foo bar` still exists when it should not. If I remove the _symlink_format_manifest directory and regenerate the manifest, I will get:

```
.
└── myPartition=baz bax
   └── manifest
```

Which is expected.

#### Further details

The problem seems to occur if there are spaces, punctuation, or other special characters in the name of a partition. The `generate("symlink_format_manifest")` does not delete the outdated manifest files in these partitions.
