## Description

Parent issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/4289

Introduces `IcebergWriterCompatV1MetadataValidatorAndUpdater` which performs the metadata validation and updates for the writer feature IcebergWriterCompatV1:
```
/**
 * Performs the validations and updates necessary to support the table feature IcebergWriterCompatV1
 * when it is enabled by the table property "delta.enableIcebergWriterCompatV1".
 *
 * <p>Requires that the following table properties are set to the specified values. If they are set
 * to an invalid value, throws an exception. If they are not set, enable them if possible.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Requires ID column mapping mode (cannot be enabled on existing table).
 *   <li>Requires icebergCompatV2 to be enabled.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Checks that required table features are enabled: icebergCompatWriterV1, icebergCompatV2,
 * columnMapping
 *
 * <p>Checks the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Checks that all table features supported in the table's protocol are in the allow-list of
 *       table features. This simultaneously ensures that any unsupported features are not present
 *       (e.g. CDF, variant type, etc).
 *   <li>Checks that there are no fields with data type byte or short.
 *   <li>Checks that the table feature `invariants` is not active in the table (i.e. there are
 *   no invariants in the table schema). This is a special case where the incompatible feature
 *   `invariants` is in the allow-list of features since it is included by default in the table
 *   protocol for new tables. Since it is incompatible we must verify that it is inactive in
 *   the table.
 * </ul>

```

## How was this patch tested?

Adds unit tests.

Note - we refactor the tests in `IcebergCompatV2MetadataValidatorAndUpdaterSuite` so that we can run them for `icebergCompatV2` and for `icebergWriterCompatV1` since `icebergWriterCompatV1` enables and enforces `icebergCompatV2`.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, after all tasks in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/4289 are complete a new writer feature will be supported.
