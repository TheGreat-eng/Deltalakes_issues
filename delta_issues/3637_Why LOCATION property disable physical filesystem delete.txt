Hi! Why LOCATION property set explicitly changes DROP TABLE behaviour ?

```sql

CREATE TABLE test.t19(i int,s string)
USING DELTA;

-- Delta log is located here: dbfs:/warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/test.db/t19

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.t19;
```

Delta log is deleted.

But in this case

``` sql
CREATE TABLE test.t19(i int,s string)
USING DELTA
LOCATION 'dbfs:/warehouse/tablespace/managed/hive/test.db/t19';

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.t19;
```

Delta log is not deleted from dbfs. Is it expected behaviour ?
