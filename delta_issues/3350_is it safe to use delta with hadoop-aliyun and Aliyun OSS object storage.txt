Hi,  

I'm testing delta with hadoop-aliyun to create Delta table on Aliyun OSS:

https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-aliyun/tools/hadoop-aliyun/index.html

This document mentions some warnings, eg. delete() and rename() are not atomic.  I checked git repositories of Hudi and Iceberg, they have explicit support for Aliyun OSS, but Delta code is purely neutral to cloud service providers, so I want to confirm, is it safe to use Delta with hadoop-aliyun and Aliyun OSS object storage?

Thanks!
