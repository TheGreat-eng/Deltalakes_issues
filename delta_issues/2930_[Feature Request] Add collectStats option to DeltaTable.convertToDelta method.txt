## Feature request

Here's the current method signature for `DeltaTable.convertToDelta`:

```python
DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, identifier, partitionSchema)
```

It'd be nice if there was a `collectStats` option that'd let users skip statistics collection if that's a bottleneck when they're trying to convert a Parquet lake to a Delta Lake.

### Further details

Looks like `collectStats` is set to false in [this file](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/ConvertToDeltaCommand.scala).  Perhaps it'll be relatively straightforward to expose this option via the different language APIs.
