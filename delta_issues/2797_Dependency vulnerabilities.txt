Maven Reports 2 vulnerabilities for this application [Delta Core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.delta/delta-core)

* [Scala Library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library) » [2.13.5](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.5) has issue https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36944

Both have upgraded to newer versions without these vulnerabilities [Scala Library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library) » [2.13.10](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10) and [JUnit](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit) » [4.13.2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/4.13.2)

So I was wondering if there was a way to get these dependencies upgraded to remove the 2 vulnerabilities. 

With best regards
