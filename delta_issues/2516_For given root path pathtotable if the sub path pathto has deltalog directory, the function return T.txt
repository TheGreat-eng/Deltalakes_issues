## Bug
For given root path: "/path/to/table"  if the sub path "/path/to" has deltalog directory, the function return True

### Describe the problem
 I am using isDeltaTable method (Delta version 2.0.0) in my Jupyter notebook and have weird behavior with this code:
DeltaTable.isDeltaTable(spark, "/path/to/table")
For given root path: "/path/to/table"  if the sub path "/path/to" has deltalog directory, the function return True.

The Documentation the provided is:
"classmethod isDeltaTable(sparkSession: pyspark.sql.session.SparkSession, identifier: str) â†’ bool
Check if the provided identifier string, in this case a file path, is the root of a Delta table using the given SparkSession."
(https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/python/index.html)
So the question is : if the root the I provided path don't contains Delta table ,
 but the sub-root path has delta table and 'isDeltaTable' returns True - is this not a bug? or am I missing something?


#### Expected results
For given root path  isDeltaTable will return True if there is Delta table only in at the root path, 
and False otherwise(even if in the sub-path there is delta log)
