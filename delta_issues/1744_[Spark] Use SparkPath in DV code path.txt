## Description

This PR refactors the DV code path to use the `SparkPath` helper and clarifies requirements of whether a path string should or should not be escaped.

This PR also touches on some test cases as a preparation for testing tables with special characters -- which relies on a new Spark release and thus not shipped with this PR.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
