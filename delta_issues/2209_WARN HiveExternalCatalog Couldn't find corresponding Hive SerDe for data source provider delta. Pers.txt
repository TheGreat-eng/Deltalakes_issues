**It appears that this error should not be disregarded.
We encountered significant traffic issues related to this last Friday.**
Here are the details:
1. We are using Delta as the storage layer and Hive 3.x as the metastore.
2. We obtained a dataframe with a complex structure as follows:
```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

val innerStruct = StructType(Array(
  StructField("image", StringType),
  StructField("content", StringType)
))

val outerStruct = StructType(Array(
  StructField("some_detail", innerStruct)
))

val schema = StructType(Array(
  StructField("detail", outerStruct)
))

val data = Seq(
  Row(Row(Row("image_example", "content_text_example")))
)

val df = spark.createDataFrame(
  spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data),
  schema
)

df.write.format("delta").save("s3://path")
```

We then created a delta table:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE test.test_table_name USING delta LOCATION 's3://path'
```
However, we ended up with a record in the Hive metastore database `sds` with a `Location` row like:

```TXT
hdfs://[our-emr-cluster-id]/xxxxx/yyy
```
instead of `s3://path`!
This is a significant issue because when you want to release the current cluster and create a new one, you will encounter a major bug!
You might think that your data and computing resources are separated, but you will find that the metastore still refers to the old, released cluster!
I sincerely hope to receive a response from the community on this issue.
