For the issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/44, added delete implementation in `DeleteCommand`.

Based on the modification, users can create a `DeltaTable` and delete rows of the table which matches the condition. The condition is optional and has `String` and 'Column' two types supported.

sample usage:
`deltaTable = new DeltaTable(spark.table(tableName))`
`deltaTable.delete("key = 1")`
`deltaTable.delete(functions.expr("key = 2"))`
`deltaTable.delete()`
