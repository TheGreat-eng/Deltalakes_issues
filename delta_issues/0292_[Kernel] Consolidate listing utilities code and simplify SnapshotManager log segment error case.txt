## Description

We used to have several duplicated log directory listing utilities. This PR cleans that up so there's just one utility method.

I also got rid of the listing utility that returns an `Optional<List<FileStatus>>`. If we cannot find the `_delta_log` folder, we throw an exception. If the `_delta_log` folder is empty, we should return an empty list.

## How was this patch tested?

Just a refactor. Existing UTs.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
