## Description

Provides implementations for `getChild` for column vectors that are missing them.

## How was this patch tested?

Adds simple tests for `DefaultViewVector` and `DefaultGenericVector` (used by complex types in the JSON handler).
https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2131 also is based off these changes and uses `getChild` instead of `getStruct` everywhere in the code.
