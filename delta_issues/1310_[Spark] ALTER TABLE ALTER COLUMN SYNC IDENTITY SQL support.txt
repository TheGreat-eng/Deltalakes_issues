## Description
This PR is part of https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1959
In this PR, we add SQL support for `ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SYNC IDENTITY`. 

This is used for GENERATED BY DEFAULT Identity Columns, where a user may want to manually update the identity column high watermark. 

## How was this patch tested?
This PR adds a new test suite `IdentityColumnSyncSuite`.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

<!--

-->
Yes. We introduce the SQL syntax `ALTER TABLE (ALTER| CHANGE) COLUMN? <colName> SYNC IDENTITY` into Delta. This will update the high watermark stored in the metadata for that specific identity column.
**Example Usage**
```
ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN id SYNC IDENTITY
ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN id SYNC IDENTITY
ALTER TABLE ALTER id SYNC IDENTITY
ALTER TABLE CHANGE id SYNC IDENTITY
```
