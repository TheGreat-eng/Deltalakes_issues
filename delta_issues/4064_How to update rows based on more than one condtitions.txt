May I know how to update rows based on the conditions like below?

deltaTable
.merge(
    sourceDF.as("s")   
    "id == s.oldId")
.whenMatched(num = 1)
.updateExpr(updateRecords1)
.whenMatched(num = 2)
.updateExpr(updateRecords2)

But There can be at most one update action and one delete action in whenMatched clauses.
Two update actions are not allowed.
Is there a way to solve such a thingï¼Ÿ
or just merge twice?

Wish for your feedback :)
