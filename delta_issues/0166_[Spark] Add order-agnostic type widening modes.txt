## Description
All code paths implementing type widening so far had a clear 'before' and 'after' schema and checked that 'before' could be widened to 'after'.
An additional use case is, given two schemas from two separate flows, to compute wider schema from the two.
To support this, 'bidirectional' widening modes are added to `SchemaMergingUtils.mergeSchemas()`.
These allow picking the wider of the two input types, or, for decimals, picking a decimal type that is wider than each input.

## How was this patch tested?
Added unit tests for `SchemaMergingUtils.mergeSchemas()`.
