## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

Related to the Druid-Delta Lake connector https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15755. Currently in 3.0.0, the `Table` interface only supports reading the [latest](https://docs.delta.io/3.0.0/api/java/kernel/io/delta/kernel/Table.html#getLatestSnapshot-io.delta.kernel.client.TableClient-) snapshot. I see the same for the pre-release version [3.1.0](https://docs.delta.io/3.1.0/api/java/kernel/index.html). How feasible would it be to add support for reading arbitrary snapshots in the Delta Kernel?
