Hi, I have a delta table integrated with the AWS Glue data catalog. 

When running a query against the table via spark, I am getting the following error:

<code>
FileReadException: Error while reading file s3://.. _symlink_format_manifest/manifest

Caused by: RuntimeException: .../manifest is not a Parquet file. expected magic number at tail`
</code>

And the integrated spectrum table is generating a 

<code>
 S3ServiceException:The specified key does not exist.,Status 404,Error NoSuchKey
</code>

Furthermore, not all partitions are added after attempting to generate the manifests even though there are files in the partition.

I ran the Spark SQL on a Databricks Cluster with runtime: 8.1 - Apache Spark 3.1.1 and Delta 1.0.0

Please let me know if i can supply more details.
