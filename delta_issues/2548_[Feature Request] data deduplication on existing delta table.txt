## Feature request

### Overview

In some cases, we would prefer to do data deduplication on a regular basis rather than when upserting.  A single command for this purpose would be quite useful. 

### Motivation

Several approaches are proposed online with regards to data de-duplication on delta tables. Some target deduplication when inserting, others propose complex merge operations for existing tables. 


### Further details

Propose to implement a command in the form

`deltaTable.dropDuplicates(cols, where, keep="first")`

such that rows with duplicates on the columns given by the cols parameter are dropped when the given conditions specified by the where parameter. The conditions should be a filter, on partition columns or other.
