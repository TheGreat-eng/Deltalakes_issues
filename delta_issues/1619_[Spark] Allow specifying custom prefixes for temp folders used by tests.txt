## Description

This PR introduces a new trait, `DeltaSQLTestUtils`, to be used by all tests as a replacement for Apache Spark's `SQLTestUtils.` The new trait provides an ability for each test to specify a custom name prefix for temporary folders, so we can test the behavior of Delta Lake when a table's path contains special characters.

## How was this patch tested?

Not needed.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
