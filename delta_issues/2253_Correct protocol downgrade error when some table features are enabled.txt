## Description

This PR improves the logic of deciding protocol versions in ALTER TABLE commands. Specifically, when a query specifies a lower protocol version along with a table prop that enables a table feature, we will try to "correct" the lower protocol version to a higher one that supports the said table feature. Some examples:
```sql
-- table has Protocol(2, 2)
ALTER TABLE table SET TBLPROPERTIES (
	delta.minWriterVersion = '1',
	delta.enableChangeDataFeed = 'true'
)
-- before: cannot downgrade from Protocol(2, 2) to Protocol(2, 1)
-- after: table now have Protocol(2, 4)
```
```sql
-- table has Protocol(2, 2)
ALTER TABLE table SET TBLPROPERTIES (
	delta.minReaderVersion = '1',
	delta.minWriterVersion = '1',
	delta.enableChangeDataFeed = 'true'
)
-- before: cannot downgrade from Protocol(2, 2) to Protocol(1, 1)
-- after: cannot downgrade from Protocol(2, 2) to Protocol(1, 4)
```
```sql
-- table has Protocol(2, 2)
ALTER TABLE table SET TBLPROPERTIES (
	delta.minReaderVersion = '1',
	delta.minWriterVersion = '1',
	delta.enableDeletionVectors = 'true'
)
-- before: cannot downgrade from Protocol(2, 2) to Protocol(1, 1)
-- after: table now have Protocol(3, 7)
