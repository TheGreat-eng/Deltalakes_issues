## Description

The protocol spec accidentally described the version field for the DV file format as being `0 - 1`, i.e. a 2-byte range, but in truth it's only a single byte. This was likely a left-over from when the spec describe the ranges with exclusive bounds, rather than inclusive. This PR corrects this to clarify that only byte 0 contains the version number.
