I am using Spark 3.2 on Azure Synapse Analytics which includes Delta 1.2.0. As per the documentation here --> [https://docs.delta.io/latest/optimizations-oss.html#z-ordering-multi-dimensional-clustering](https://docs.delta.io/latest/optimizations-oss.html#z-ordering-multi-dimensional-clustering), Z-Order is supported with Delta 2.0.0. and higher. However, we are able to run Z-Order with Delta 1.2.0 as well in Azure Synapse Analytics with Spark 3.2 cluster having Delta 1.2. We tried running the same on Azure Databricks and the outcome was same. Can you please confirm Delta 1.2.0 supports Z-Order or not? 

Thanks!
