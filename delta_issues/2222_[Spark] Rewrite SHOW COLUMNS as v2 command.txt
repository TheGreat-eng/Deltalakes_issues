## Description

The Delta verison of SHOW COLUMNS command used to rely on a hacky custom SQL parser rule, but it turns out this is unnecessary -- we can simply add a new DeltaAnalysis rule to intercept the v2 `ShowColumns` command, and replace it with the Delta-specific `ShowDeltaTableColumnsCommand` (which we rename and also upgrade to v2, so it doesn't trigger extra catalog lookups any more).

## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
