## Description

https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3115 added logging for the java style checks, but incidentally made it such that `kernelApi / checkstyle` doesn't fail when there are errors (only `kernelApi / compile` fails).

This PR makes it so that `kernelApi / checkstyle` will also fail, but it will NOT log the errors. 
- I can't find a way to override the `checkstyle` task defined by the plugin. I _can_ do it for `kernelApi / Compile / checkstyle` but that doesn't seem very helpful.

## How was this patch tested?

Checked the commands locally.
