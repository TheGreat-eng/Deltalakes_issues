## Description

Add config to run MERGE source materialization eagerly.
Add a new config that that controls whether the MERGE source is materialized eagerly or lazily.
New config is set to eager by default to avoid suspected determinism issues with lazy materialization.

## How was this patch tested?

Run most sensitive tests with both eager and lazy settings, the rest only with the default to not blow up the CI time unnecessarily.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
