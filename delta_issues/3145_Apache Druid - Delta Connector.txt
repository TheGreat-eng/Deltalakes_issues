## Feature request

Hello.

presto has recently created a [delta.io](http://delta.io/) adapter to link delta files directly, this is making me consider to use a presto cluster instead (would scale decently enough with current data load I have to work with).
However, is there anyone who has faced this issue and solved it in a “nice” way, or are there any plans to add a delta connector similar to what presto has done?

### Overview

Here is a reference to what presto has added: https://prestodb.io/blog/2022/03/15/native-delta-lake-connector-for-presto

### Motivation

To utilise apache druid for centralising a lakehouse architecture with delta.io as the base data layer.

### Further details

And a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrXGkqpl7xk (fast forward to `21:40`) this is what would be nice to have but within apache druid.
