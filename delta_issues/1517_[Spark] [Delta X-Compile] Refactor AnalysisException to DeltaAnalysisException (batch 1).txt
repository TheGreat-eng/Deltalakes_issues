## Description

We want Delta to cross-compile against both Spark 3.5 and Spark Master (4.0).

Unfortunately, the constructor `new AnalysisException("msg")` became protected in Spark 4.0, meaning that all such occurances do not compile against Spark 3.5.

Thus, we decided to:
- replace `AnalysisException` with `DeltaAnalysisException`
- use errorClasses
- assign temporary error classes when needed to speed this along

This PR replaces the first 5 (of ~20) compilation errors.

## How was this patch tested?

New UTs in `DeltaErrorsSuite`.

Also, cherry-picked to the oss-cross-compile branch (https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2780) and cross-compiled:
- (this branch) Spark 3.5: âœ… 
- (this branch) Spark 4.0: 11 compilation errors. (the oss-cross-compile branch has 16 compilation errors, this is expected)

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
