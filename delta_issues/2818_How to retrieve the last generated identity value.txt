I am using identity column to auto generate the value for one of the column. 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS T_EMPLOYEE
(
	EMPLOYEE_ID BIGINT NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1),
	EMPLOYEE_NAME STRING NOT NULL
) 

Insert into T_EMPLOYEE values ('employee_1')

Now, to get the identity generated value for above insert, I need to run another sql query on T_EMPLOYEE table. such as

select  EMPLOYEE_ID from T_EMPLOYEE where EMPLOYEE_ID = 'employee_1'

Is there any other way to get the generated identity value without running another query? For e.g. MS SQL Server has scope_identity function.

Thanks in advance.
