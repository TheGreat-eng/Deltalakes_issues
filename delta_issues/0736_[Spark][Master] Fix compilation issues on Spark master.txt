## Description

Spark master compilation is currently broken due to this commit in Spark
https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a767f5cb1704075ee249169e8faf2ab3610b9dbc#diff-81eca9f7af2e9b23b13904131c3d32b0af9e9e1dcc7ddb5efba13201b00066c4 which changes the `Column` constructor. 

To fix, change any instances of `new Column(...)` to `Column(...)` so that we can use the constructors in `object Column`.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests suffice.
