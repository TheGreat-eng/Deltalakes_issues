## Description
Resolves https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1699

Updates `DeltaSourceSnapshot` with a few improvements, most notably loading actions for the snapshot incrementally using `toLocalIterator` instead of `collect`'ing the entire snapshot on the driver and keeping it there. If we're worried about performance aspects of `toLocalIterator` I can put the two different methods behind a feature flag.

Additionally:
- Adds a `repartitionByRange` before the sort on time and path to control the number of output partitions of the sort. Without this the default shuffle partitions are used, which can be large for large datasets and make `toLocalIterator` as well as `collect` take longer.
- Skip encoding the cached dataset as an `IndexedRow` because it is immediately converted back to a DataFrame to create the iterator.
- Includes the same updates as https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1703 to drop stats before creating streaming file indices
- Uncaches the `Delta Source Snapshot` in addition to the underlying `Snapshot` on close
