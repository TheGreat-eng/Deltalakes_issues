## Description

This PR blocks CDF read queries (batch, streaming) in Delta Lake whenever column mapping (CM) is enabled. We do this because CDF + CM semantics are currently undefined.

## How was this patch tested?

Adds a new unit test and covers cases of
- batch read with CM, CDF disabled -> okay
- stream read with CM, CDF disabled -> okay
- batch read with CM, CDF enabled -> blocked
- stream read with CM, CDF enabled -> blocked

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No. Not 'new' as CDF is not yet released in Delta Lake.
