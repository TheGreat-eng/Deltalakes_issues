It seems that all the examples are using local delta-files.

How would I provide the correct auth (or PAT) and table locations to delta-kernel to read?
I guess somehow with the HadoopConfiguration?

Tried to start with the BaseTableReader examples, but didn't get far.

And passing an s3 location for the table path yielded just an error:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.hadoop.fs.UnsupportedFileSystemException: No FileSystem for scheme "s3"
	at io.delta.kernel.internal.TableImpl.forPath(TableImpl.java:33)
