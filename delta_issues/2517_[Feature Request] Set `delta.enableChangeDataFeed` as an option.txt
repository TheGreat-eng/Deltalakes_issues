## Feature request

### Overview

Set property "delta.enableChangeDataFeed" as an option of `DataStreamWriter[T]`. 

### Motivation

Currently, to activate the feature "Change Data Feed" (CDF), a table must be created via a SQL statement or via the utility `DeltaTable.create...()`, and the above property set as a table property set to `true`. The aim of this request is to allow to programmatically activate the feature CDF as an option of a `DataStreamWriter`, without having to create a table. For example, the following should be allowed:

```scala
val df = ...
df.writeStream
  .option("delta.enableChangeDataFeed", true)
  ...
  .start(location)
```

As far as I can tell, this is not possible today, or it is not documented.

### Further details

There are three cases to consider when setting this option:
1) the `location` does not exist. Then the `location` is created as expected and CDF is activated at creation.
2) the `location` already exists, all applicable checks pass (ex: schema compatibility), but CDF is not yet activated. If the property `"delta.enableChangeDataFeed"` is set to `true`, then CDF is activated at this time only.
3) the `location` already exists and CDF is already activated. In this case, any value set for option `""delta.enableChangeDataFeed"` is ignored and CDF continues to be activated.
