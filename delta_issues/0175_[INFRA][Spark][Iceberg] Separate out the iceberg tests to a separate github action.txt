## Description

Separates out the iceberg tests to a separate github action. Also makes the unidoc settings dependent on an environmental variable `DISABLE_UNIDOC`. This is useful because due to unidoc, running tests compiles all the projects in the entire repo. If you disable unidoc, you can, for example, run `spark / test` without compiling the iceberg projects.
