I've a frequently updated partition table, partitioned by date.

Data volume under each partition is not so large, less than 100MB each date. But log files under _delta_log folder is very large, i see more than 4000 files, sum to 46GB log files. The table is frequently updated.

We have a parquet mirror table of this delta lake table, which includes the latest version. Read performance on same piece of data on parquet data is much faster than delta lake table.

I'm not sure whether it os because of the very large _delta_log. Is there any way to optimize it?
