#696 tried to expose the existing `org.apache.spark.sql.delta.hooks.PostCommitHook` to the user. However, currently it is not designed for external use. For example, it exposes multiple private classes such as `OptimisticTransactionImpl` and `Action` which may be changed in any future versions.

We need to design a new user facing PostCommitHook API instead.
