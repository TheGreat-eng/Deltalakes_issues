## Description

This PR addresses a potential data loss when using the external-log-store mechanism.
The vulnerability is based on the fact that delta_log version is determined at the beginning of the `DataFrameWriter.save()` function,
prior to the part in which the dataset is written to parquet files.
Since this action might take long (due to sparks laziness), 
there is a need to validate that `N.json` wasn't added to the filesystem (and deleted from the external log-store by the ttl) during that time. 
The validation should occur as close as possible to locking `N.json` in the external log-store.

"Resolves #1410"- and extensively explained there.

## Extra
Even after this fix, the ttl suggested [here](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-storage.html#production-configuration-s3-multi-cluster:~:text=Run%20the%20following%20command%20on%20your%20given%20DynamoDB%20table%20to%20enable%20TTL) might lead to data loss.
Since it has no suspension - a record might be deleted immediately after committed,
This scenario might occur:
1. writer **A** checks if `N.json` is in filesystem and it isn't.
2.  writer **B** locks `N.json` in external log-store.
3. writer **B** saves `N.json` to filesystems delta_log.
4. writer **B** commits `N.json` in external log-store.
5. `N.json` is deleted from external log-store by ttl.
6. writer **A** locks `N.json` in external log-store (and succeeds).
7. writer **A** saves `N.json` to filesystems delta_log and overwrites writer **B**'s log file.

The above scenario is very unlikely, but in order to stay 100% safe, a ttl with suspension can be considered.
