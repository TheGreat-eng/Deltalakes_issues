This PR adds type annotations for Python module, provided as stub files.

This should:

- Improve auto-completion performance in editors which support type hints.
- Optionally enable static checking through mypy or built-in tools (for example Pycharm tools).
- Provide additional way to document usage of certain methods, where arguments are required, despite providing default values.
