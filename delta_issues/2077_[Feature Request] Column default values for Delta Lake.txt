## Feature request

### Overview

This is a proposal to support column default values for Delta Lake tables.
Users should be able to associate default values with Delta Lake columns at table creation time or thereafter.

### Motivation

Support for column defaults is a key requirement to facilitate updating the  table schema over time and performing  DML operations on wide tables with sparse data.

### Further details

Please refer to an open design doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTyozwH8A4lemW_wNq7YC7GpuTzNn19NUZQ_pw9dDJNYBuhmdqDunauqmLr0qIuD8kQRNI7a4x72c55/pub).

This should integrate with [Apache Spark's column default feature](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38334), and also represent the column metadata in a general way such that other Delta Lake clients can understand it.

* Users must be able to CREATE and and ALTER tables to assign non-NULL default values to columns.
* The system should support defaults of NULL, literals, or constant expressions based on built-in functions. 
* The system should support omitting columns from explicit column lists in INSERT commands and MERGE INSERT actions.
* The system should support DEFAULT can be specified in VALUES lists and top-level SELECT queries when used in an INSERT command or MERGE INSERT action.
* DESCRIBE commands should show default column values if requested.

For example:

```
-- The CREATE TABLE statement may specify a DEFAULT value for a column.
CREATE TABLE T (a INT, c STRING DEFAULT CONCAT(‘abc’, ‘def’))
  USING DELTA;
INSERT INTO T(a) VALUES (42);
INSERT INTO T VALUES (43, DEFAULT);
SELECT * FROM T;
(42, ‘abcdef’)
(43, ‘abcdef’)
```
