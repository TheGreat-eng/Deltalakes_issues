### Overview

Support HMS-based iceberg in Delta Uniform

### Motivation

Delta Uniform in preview release uses file-system based iceberg, which is not the mainstream Iceberg use case and constraints adoption. As most Iceberg customers have catalog and use catalog to manage the Iceberg table commits, it is a generally critical ask to have Delta Uniform (Universal Format) to support Iceberg catalog. The customer would like to read Delta Uniform table as Iceberg from an Iceberg catalog, eg, HMS. 


### Further details
This requires Uniform to commit all required iceberg metadata (table type, metadata location) to HMS as table properties.

This require catalog support to be first-class citizen of Delta, so Delta can pass catalog table identifier all the way from Spark/Delta commands to Delta transaction to iceberg conversion transaction to underlying iceberg library, which can then use the table identifier to commit to HMS.
