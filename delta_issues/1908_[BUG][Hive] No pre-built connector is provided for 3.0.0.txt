### Describe the problem

https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/connectors/hive/README.md says:

> This project is a library to make Hive read Delta tables. The project provides a uber JAR delta-hive-assembly_<scala_version>-<delta_connectors_version>.jar to use in Hive. You can use either Scala 2.11, 2.12 or 2.13. Release JARs for versions <= 0.6.0 are available in the deprecated delta-io/connectors repository [releases](https://github.com/delta-io/connectors/releases) page. Newer JARs are available in the delta-io/delta [releases](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases) page, starting at version 3.0. Please download the uber JAR for the corresponding Scala version you would like to use.

However, https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases/tag/v3.0.0 doesn't provide uber JARs for the Hive connector the way https://github.com/delta-io/connectors/releases/tag/v0.6.0 did. The uber JAR isn't published to Maven Central either, only the slim delta-hive is.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases/tag/v3.0.0 and try to locate delta-hive-assembly_2.12-3.0.0.jar

#### Observed results

No pre-built JAR found

#### Expected results

A hyperlink to an uber JAR for the Hive connector to Delta Lake 3.0.0
