## Description

This PR fixes a `PLAN_VALIDATION_FAILED_RULE_EXECUTOR` error that occurs when reading the CDF of a commit range that contains no file actions and when reading a generated column. In this case `DeltaCDFRelation.buildScan` will add a `Project` or `Filter` containing `AttributeReference`s with empty `metadata` on top of a plan where the `metadata`. This will cause `hasUniqueExprIdsForOutput` to trip, but only if the plan does not contain a `Union`, which is only the case when reading the CDF of a commit range without any file actions.

The fix is to substitute the attribute references in the projections and filters entirely, instead of just patching up the expression ids. (I am not sure why I didn't simply do this in the first place.)

## How was this patch tested?

Modified an existing test to reproduce the error.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
