## Description
Currently, the log replay code used to find the active add files in a table snapshot is not observable. Add a few metrics to provide visibility into the log replay. These metrics are collected as the `CloseableIterator` of scan files is consumed and printed in slf4j logs when the iterator is closed. Following are the metrics collected:

* number of `AddFile` actions seen
* number of `AddFile` actions seen from delta files
* number of duplicate `AddFile` actions seen
* number of tombstones seen
* number of active `AddFile`s

## How was this patch tested?
Add unit tests with different scenarios
* deltas only
* checkpoint class/multi-parts,
* stats recompute - generates duplicate add files, 
* removes - generates tombstones)

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No, but the info level logs will have a message with the log replay metrics.
