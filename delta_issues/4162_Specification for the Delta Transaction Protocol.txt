This PR adds a specification for the Delta Transaction Protocol. The goal of this specification is to allow other implementors to build integrations that read and write from a Delta table. This is an early draft that should contain all the information needed to correctly read from a delta table. There are TODOs later in the document, that will be fleshed out in a future PR, on the additional requirements for modifying a table.
