## Feature request

### Overview

This [commit](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/d90f90b6656648e170835f92152b69f77346dfcf) added 3 new TahoeFileIndex's for the Change Data Feed feature currently being developed for Delta Lake. These are: `CdcAddFileIndex`, `TahoeChangeFileIndex`, and `TahoeRemoveFileIndex`.

These three classes have lots of similar code paths + logic, and can be consolidated to a simpler abstract base class + children to reduce duplicate code.

Feel free to give them better class names, too.

### Motivation

Clean up the code. Less code duplication. Better file and class names. Easier to maintain and debug in the future.
