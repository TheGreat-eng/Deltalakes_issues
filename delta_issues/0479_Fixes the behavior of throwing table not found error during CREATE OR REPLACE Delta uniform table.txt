## Description

If its the first time we are creating the delta uniform table and the table does not exist yet, we want to synchronously trigger the uniform conversion after the CreateDeltaTableCommand have created the table in the catalog; The existing code only checked for isReplace, but it missed to check if the table existed in the catalog or not.  Adding this check fixes the behavior of throwing table not found error during CREATE OR REPLACE Delta uniform table for the very first time.
