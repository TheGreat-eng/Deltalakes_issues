### Overview

Currently, Delta-Spark [Scala extensions](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/util/ScalaExtensions.scala) contains `whenNot, which is identical to functionality in Scala 2.13 `Option.unless`. We should update ScalaExtensions (and callers) to change this method to `Option.unless` such that we can eventually migrate to Scala 2.13 and remove the ScalaExtensions.
