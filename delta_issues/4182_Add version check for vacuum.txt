Currently, delta support user to delete data files via vacuum interface and we only need to set the time params.  At the same time delta support time travel reading start from specific version, this version will go ahead when commit log is cleaned. So there is a scene, we currently can read version (2 to latest), then we do vacuum gc. Because there is no check for vacuum to check whether you have delete the data file that you supposed can read via time travel(such as version 2), so you may delete the version 2 data files. Sometime we just want to delete the data files which we can't reach(out of time travel), so if delta can add a check here to warning user may help a lot.

Maybe we can set the vacuum time param greater than the commit log gc time, but if we run the spark job in different machine the clock may have some bias.
