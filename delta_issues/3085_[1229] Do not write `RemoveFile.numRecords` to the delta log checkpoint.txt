## Description

Resolves delta-io/delta#1229.

This PR ensures that `RemoveFile.numRecords` field is not written out to the delta checkpoint. We do this by removing `numRecords` from the `RemoveFile` constructor.

## How was this patch tested?
We write out a checkpoint, and read it back as parquet, and ensure that its schema does not contain `numRecords`.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
