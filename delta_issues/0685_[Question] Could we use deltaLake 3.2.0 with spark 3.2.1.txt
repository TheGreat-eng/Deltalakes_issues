Currently, we are using version spark 3.2.1 with deltalake 2.0.1.

And when I checked the compatibility metric below,
https://docs.delta.io/latest/releases.html#compatibility-with-apache-spark

I saw that deltalake 3.2.0 is compatible with spark 3.5.x. However, the release note says just spark 3.5.x support, which is confusing.

The intention of my question is **if the minimum compatible spark version of deltalake 3.2.0 is 3.5.x.**

Also, I know that when you do deltalake version up, things like protocol version are important. Is there a guide document for upgrading the delta-lake version?
