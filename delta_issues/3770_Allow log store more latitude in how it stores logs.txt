This PR extends the LogStore trait to allow implementers more flexibility in how the LogStore stores data. Specifically, it decouples the precise filename of a delta log file from the relevant information: version, file type etc.



Changes in this PR:

* A case class which holds the relevant file properties

* a parser which creates file properties classes from filenames

* scaffolding to change the parser impl in the same manner that the LogStore impl is changed

* a new method on the LogStore to similarly control the checkpoint file as this currently does not pass through the LogStore interface
