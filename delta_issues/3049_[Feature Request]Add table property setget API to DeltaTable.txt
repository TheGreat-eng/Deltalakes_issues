## Feature request

### Overview

Delta Lake API should support table property read and write.

### Motivation
As for 1.2.1, all Delta Lake APIs are about the data but not a single one about table properties/metatable.

Imagine that you would like to change log retention period if it's too long. You have to start up a spark-shell and run `ALTER TABLE delta.`hdfs:///mypath` SET TBLPROPERTIES('delta.logRetentionDuration' = '7 days')` and it is not clearly documented in https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-batch.html#table-properties. 

What about an API like `DeltaTable.getProperty("delta.logRetentionDuration")` and  `DeltaTable.setProperty("delta.logRetentionDuration", "7 days")`?

### Further details

It will also be handy to support:
`DeltaTable.getProperties()` to get all delta related properties.
`DeltaTable.setProperties(<map of properties>)` to set multiple properties at once.
