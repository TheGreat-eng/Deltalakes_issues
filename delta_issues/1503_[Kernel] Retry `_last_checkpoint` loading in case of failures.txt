## Description
Currently, Kernel stops on first failure at loading the `_last_checkpoint` file (which contains info about the last checkpoint). We should have mechanisms to retry just like how Delta-Spark retries on retryable failures. More details are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Nock1I8-143Dwidj8rMpgt3wAicrOI2OvDJt3OufOQ/edit?usp=sharing).
