Support OptimizeWrite described in https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/auto-optimize.html#how-optimized-writes-work

Fixes #1158

If OptimizeWrite is enabled, inject `OptimizeWriteExchangeExec` on top of the write plan and remove `ShuffleExchangeExec` or `CoalesceExchange` operation at the top of the plan to avoid unnecessary shuffle / stage.

In OptimizeWriteExchangeExec, 
1) Repartition data
    - `RoundRobinPartitining` for non partitioned data, `HashPartitioning` for partitioned data.
    - Use `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` for partitioning. We can introduce a new config like `spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.initialPartitionNum` if needed.
2) Rebalance partitions for write
    - Step1 - merge small partitions (`CoalescedPartitionSpec`)
    - Step2 - split large partitions (`PartialReducerPartitionSpec`)
    - targetSize config: `spark.databricks.delta.optimizeWrite.binSize` (default: 128MB)

#### How to enable

Ref: https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/auto-optimize.html#enable-auto-optimize
We can enable OptimizeWrite using Spark session config or table property.

1. Spark session config
    - `spark.databricks.delta.optimizeWrite.enabled` = true
    - applied for write operations of all Delta tables)
2. Table property
    - `delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite` = true

Spark session config is prior to the table property.
