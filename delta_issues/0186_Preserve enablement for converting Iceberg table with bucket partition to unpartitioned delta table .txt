## Description
Once bucket partition to nonpartition is enabled for a table, the clone from iceberg table will always convert bucket partition to non-partition for that table, regardless of if the flag is turned off or not in the future. This is to make those tables forward compatible with future Deltas where "truly" bucket conversion is supported so they will keep the old behavior and won't make regressions
