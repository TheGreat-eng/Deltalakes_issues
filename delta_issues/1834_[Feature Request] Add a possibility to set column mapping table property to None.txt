### Overview

Currently enabling column mapping on a table is an irrevocable operation.
There should be a way to remove the feature.

### Motivation
Column mapping requires delta readers to have an updated protocol version. 
To maintain compatibility with older readers, it should be possible to downgrade the table.

To replace physical column names with logical a full rewrite is required. 
It is to explore if we can avoid a full rewrite by, for example, offering to keep the underlying physical column names instead.
