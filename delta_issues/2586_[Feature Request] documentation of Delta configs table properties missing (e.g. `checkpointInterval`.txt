## Feature request

### Overview

Official [Delta table properties reference](https://docs.delta.io/latest/table-properties.html#delta-table-properties-reference) is missing lots of [implemented delta configs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/DeltaConfig.scala).
For example:
- `checkpointInterval`
- `enableExpiredLogCleanup`
- `enableDeletionVectors`
- `enableFullRetentionRollback`
- `enableRowIds`

I was wondering if it was not possible to **generate** the documentation from the documented source code **automatically**.
