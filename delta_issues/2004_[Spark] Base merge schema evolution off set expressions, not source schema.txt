Resolves #2300 

This updates schema evolution in merging to use the target assignment columns and expression schema to determine the new target schema instead of the source schema. The current implementation seems to only support upserting use cases, where the source schema looks like the target schema. However when using custom set expressions, there's no requirement for this to be the case. 

When auto schema migration is enabled and the target assignment column doesn't exist in the table, the column parts and the data type of the expression are used for determining schema updates, regardless of what the source schema is. For upserting cases, this works the same way, since the data types and assignment columns will match the source table. But it also supports more use cases where the source schema doesn't match the target schema.

Updated two tests that were showing this use case didn't work, to show it now does work, and added one additional test for adding a new nested column in an update.
