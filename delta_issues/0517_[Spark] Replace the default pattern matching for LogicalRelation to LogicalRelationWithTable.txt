## Description

This PR proposes to replace the default pattern matching for `LogicalRelation` to newly introduced pattern object `LogicalRelationWithTable` which will be available in upcoming Spark 4.0.

This change helps the project to modify less pieces of code when Spark makes the change to the LogicalRelation; most pattern matchings with LogicalRelation only extract the relation and catalog table, hence they fit with LogicalRelationWithTable.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests would suffice.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
