- Used Spark annotations to annotate public APIs regarding their stability 
- Copied Spark scripts to patch the generated docs files to make the annotations visible
     - Additional `:: Evolving ::` is necessary for these scripts to dynamically add badges for the annotation. Without this snippet + patching, generated Java docs do not show annotations.
     - The `generate_api_docs()` script does the following. 
          1. Generates Scala and Java docs with `sbt unidoc`
          1. Patches the docs' html, js, and css to dynamically inject badges
          1. Copies the docs to a standard location `docs/_site/api/` which will be useful for publishing the API docs in the Delta docs.
- Moved public methods in DeltaTableOperations into DeltaTable because Java docs generated by unidoc incorrectly handles inherited methods in some cases. In this case, it was showing `delete` as static methods.
