I have a general question regarding whether it's advisable or not to remove files that have been removed via OPTIMIZE or DELETE without running VACUUM. 

We are running pyspark jobs on databricks and have delta external tables. Because the tables are external, data is not automatically removed after OPTIMIZE or DELETE queries are run. 

We are writing automation that would detect where there are many left over files no longer in use in our tables. The choice is between running a full VACUUM or doing targeted deletes of files that are identified as removed in the `_delta_log`. 

Would anyone be able to advise whether we might encounter issues doing the data deletion without VACUUM? Thank you
