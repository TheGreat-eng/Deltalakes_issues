## Description

This PR changes `DeltaSourceOffset` to have a jackson `Serializer` and `Deserializer`. `DeltaSourceOffset` objects need extra adjustment of values at serialization and deserialization time, for backward compatibility. This was implemented using a hacky custom `.json` getter for serialization, and an `apply` constructor from `OffsetV2`. But some tests use a plain old `JsonUtils.mapper.readValue`, and they wouldn't get the special magic applied. With this change, the special magic is always applied. The PR also adds a specific error for arbitrary JSON parse errors.
