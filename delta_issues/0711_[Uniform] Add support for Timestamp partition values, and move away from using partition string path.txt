## Description
This change adds support for timestamp partition values in Delta Uniform and refactors to avoid using partition strings during partition value conversion from Delta->Iceberg. Instead, Delta partition values are deserialized and then converted Iceberg partition values which are stored in StructLike and passed to the DataFile builder during metadata conversion.

## How was this patch tested?

Added unit test which tests different partition data types in addition to the new support for timestamp partitions.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Before this change, the table could successfully be created but writes to the table with timestamp partition would fail. Now, writes to the table with the timestamp partition value will succeed.
