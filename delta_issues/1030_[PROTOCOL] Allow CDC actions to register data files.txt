## Description

Update the Delta PROTOCOL to allow `AddCDCFile` actions that do not add Change Data Files, but instead register Data Files that are also added by `AddFile` actions. In this case the `_change_type` column in the Data Files might not be `null`. Non-change data readers should disregard this column and only process columns defined within the table's schema.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
