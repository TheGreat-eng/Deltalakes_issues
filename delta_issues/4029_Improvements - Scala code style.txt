What were proposed in this Pull Request?

1. Scala doesn't require `Return` keyword.
2. Unwanted parentheses has been removed.
3. Curly braces removed for variable, it's need for expression.
4. map - lamdba function doesn't need anonymous function. Example - `val replacedDb = database.map(quoteIdentifier(_))`.
5. `new` keyword is only required for class not for case class, it automatically executes `apply` method.
6. Collection type check, `!columns.isEmpty` has changed to `columns.nonEmpty` for better readability.
7. dataframe object declaration from `var` change to `val` for immutability.
