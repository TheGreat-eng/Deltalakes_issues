Currently, the [`Utils.isTesting`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/105bed7d2cab807211540b166ce8b97549d4ede7/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/Utils.scala#L1878) check in tests is not reliable because the `spark.testing` system property is not set before the suites start, so the tests are relying on [this line](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/105bed7d2cab807211540b166ce8b97549d4ede7/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkFunSuite.scala#L94) in `SparkFunSuite` to set the test indicator. This is causing issues in CI because it means whether `Utils.isTesting` returns correct result depends on whether it is called after `SparkFunSuite::beforeAll` is called.

For example, some deletion vector-related suites are relying on the [`TEST_DV_NAME_PREFIX` config](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/a6db4e05d943fec019522c9c08ff0b64125cbc5d/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/sources/DeltaSQLConf.scala#L2410-L2415) to be correctly initialized in tests. However, if a previous test in the same JVM group initialized this config before `spark.testing` is correctly set by `SparkFunSuite`, the deletion vector suites would see the incorrect value of `TEST_DV_NAME_PREFIX` and fail (This is currently not an issue in master by luck but if a PR added new tests that changed the JVM grouping in CI job (https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4039, https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4040), this would incorrectly fail the PR's spark test job).

This PR fixes this by setting `spark.testing` to true in build file. Note that this flag is already set in the Spark repo but not here yet.

## How was this patch tested?

<!--
If tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to test the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.
If the changes were tested in any way other than unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step (ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future).
If the changes were not tested, please explain why.
-->

Check that the `TEST_DV_NAME_PREFIX` is correctly set for tests that run `Utils.testing` before `SparkFunSuite::beforeAll` (e.g., `org.apache.spark.sql.delta.DeltaWithNewTransactionWithCoordinatedCommitsBatch100Suite`)


## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

<!--
If yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.
If possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.
If no, write 'No'.
