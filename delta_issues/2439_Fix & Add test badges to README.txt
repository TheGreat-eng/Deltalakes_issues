## Description

Existing `test.yaml` workflow has been [renamed](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/60a582b51fff28aa73b34153b3450c136e1ce96b#diff-fa52fbfa002ceb18546f168981cb804575585fff5790257dadcf9f38abcfe1ef) and so the test badge is broken

In addition, two other tests have recently been added.  

This PR replaces the broken badge with the three tests - kernel, spark, and connectors.
