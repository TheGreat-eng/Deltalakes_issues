The AWS SDK for Java 1.x is being deprecated will enter maintenance mode on July 31, 2024. The end-of-support is effective December 31, 2025 ([Official Announcement Link](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-java-v1-x-on-december-31-2025/)).
To address the sdk deprecation, weâ€™ll need to upgrade AWS SDK Java 1.x to AWS SDK Java 2.x.
SDK v2 is a major rewrite of the version 1.x code base. For detailed differences, please refer to [What's different between the AWS SDK for Java 1.x and 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/migration-whats-different.html).

List of files in delta main branch that are currently leveraging AWS SDK v1 APIs. [These are the files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adelta-io%2Fdelta%20com.amazonaws&type=code) that we need to update for this upgrade.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

<!--
If yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.
If possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.
If no, write 'No'.
-->
Yes, users will need to specify the SDK V2 credential provider instead of SDK V1 for delta configurations
Ex: ```io.delta.storage.credentials.provider=com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider``` -> ```software.amazon.awssdk.auth.credentials.ProfileCredentialsProvider```
