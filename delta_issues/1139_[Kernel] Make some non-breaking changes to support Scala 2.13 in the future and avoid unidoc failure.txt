## Description

In preparation for a Spark 4.0 preview release branch (which will only support Scala 2.13) make the necessary changes to Kernel to reduce the later diff.
- Support Scala 2.13
- Avoid java doc missing import errors since we exclude any `internal/` files from the javadoc source files. For some reason this starts failing in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3122 but not before.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
