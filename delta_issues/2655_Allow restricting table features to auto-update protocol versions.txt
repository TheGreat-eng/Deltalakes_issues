## Description

This PR allows marking a metadata table feature as "auto-update capable", such that during ALTER TABLE when its metadata requirements are satisfied, the table's protocol will be automatically and silently bumped to the required version.

Note that this mechanism only applies to "metadata requirements". `'delta.feature.featureName' = 'supported'` table prop will still auto-update the table's protocol to support table features.

Also, this mechanism only affects existing tables. For new tables, the protocol is always set to the min version that satisfies all enabled features, aka. all features are auto-update capable.

For compatibility, legacy table features (features supported by `Protocol(2, 6)`) are always auto-update capable. Specifically, Column Mapping implements its own mechanism to block the usage without protocol version bumps.

## How was this patch tested?

New tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No. This PR affects only feature developers.
