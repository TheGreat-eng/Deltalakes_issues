## Description

Delta conflict detection widens non-deterministic expressions before applying them to the changes of the winning transaction. Unfortunately, user defined functions are marked as deterministic by default and customers need to mark them as deterministic. This can result in actually non-deterministic UDFs incorrectly being treated as deterministic. This commit makes conflict detection widen all UDFs to prevent customers from shooting themselves in the foot.
