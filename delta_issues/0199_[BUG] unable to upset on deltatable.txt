## Bug



- [ ] Spark### Describe the problem

#### Steps to reproduce

<!--
Please include copy-pastable code snippets if possible.
df_target=spark.read.format('DELTA').load(target_path)
df_target_check=df_no_duplicates.groupby(['AF_TAG_NAME','local_timestamp']).count().where('count > 1').sort('count', ascending=False)
display(df_target_check)
df_target_check.printSchema()

No data available
root
 |-- AF_TAG_NAME: string (nullable = true)
 |-- local_timestamp: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- count: long (nullable = false)




#### Observed results

display (df_no_duplicates.groupby(['AF_TAG_NAME','local_timestamp']).count().where('count > 1').sort('count', ascending=False)) 
No data available
root
 |-- AF_TAG_NAME: string (nullable = true)
 |-- DAYTIME: string (nullable = true)
 |-- MESSAGE_TYPE: string (nullable = true)
 |-- PI_POINT_NAME: string (nullable = true)
 |-- VALUE: string (nullable = true)
 |-- UTC_date: date (nullable = true)
 |-- local_timestamp: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- processed_date: string (nullable = false)
#### Expected results

merge 


#### Further details

error details 

An error occurred while calling o4898.execute.
: org.apache.spark.sql.delta.DeltaUnsupportedOperationException: Cannot perform Merge as multiple source rows matched and attempted to modify the same
target row in the Delta table in possibly conflicting ways. By SQL semantics of Merge,
when multiple source rows match on the same target row, the result may be ambiguous
as it is unclear which source row should be used to update or delete the matching
target row. You can preprocess the source table to eliminate the possibility of
multiple matches. Please refer to
