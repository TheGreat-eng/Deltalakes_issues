It would be useful to query all available versions of delta files into a single DataFrame instead of a single version. Coupled with this request: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/539 it would allow querying data over time to show how a record has changed. 

Query example (using syntax proposed in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/539 ):
```sql
select 
  delta_version() as row_version
  , *
from some_table version all
where primary_key = 1234
```
