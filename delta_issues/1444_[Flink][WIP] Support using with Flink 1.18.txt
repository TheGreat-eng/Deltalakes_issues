## Description

This adds changes to support using Delta with Flink 1.18.

## Work in progress

 - [ ] Decide if the Flink version we build against really should be changed to 1.18.1
 - [ ] Update the README with version numbers that actually support newer Flink
 - [ ] Fix the Mima settings so that it does not think that things in `io.delta.flink.internal` are actually exposed API.

I think these should be done as separate PRs but I am not sure, depending on what you think I'll either do another PR for the Mima things or fix it properly in here.

## How was this patch tested?

It was tested via the test suite (on Java 8, running on arm64 macOS) and some minor manual testing.

```
[info] Passed: Total 568, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 565, Skipped 3
[success] Total time: 1142 s (19:02), completed Apr 9, 2024 4:36:35 PM
```

If you have any ideas on how to better test this I would love to know, since I think I can see a patch to support Flink 1.19 in my future and would love to be more confident in that one.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No. It should not beyond supporting a newer version of Flink.

## Thanks

Thanks to @sdahlbac and @oskarskog for helping me with this, I definitely would not have had the patience to run the test suite this many without them.
