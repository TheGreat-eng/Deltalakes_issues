## Description
Follow on https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3605

Adds more tests covering behavior for all ways of running insert with:
- an extra column or struct field in the input, in `DeltaInsertIntoSchemaEvolutionSuite`
- a missing column or struct field in the input, in `DeltaInsertIntoImplicitCastSuite`
- a different column or field ordering than the table schema, in `DeltaInsertIntoColumnOrderSuite`

Note: tests are spread across multiple suites as each test case covers 20 different ways to run inserts, quickly leading to large test suites.

This change includes improvements to `DeltaInsertIntoTest`:
- Group all types of inserts into categories that are easier to reference in tests:
  - SQL vs. Dataframe inserts
  - Position-based vs. name-based inserts
  - Append vs. overwrite
- Provide a mechanism to ensure that each test covers all existing insert types.
