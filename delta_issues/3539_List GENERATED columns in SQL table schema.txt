When I define a table where some columns are calculated from others using the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` function (https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-batch.html#-deltausegeneratedcolumns), I can't retrieve any reference to that in the table schema (`DESCRIBE [table_name]`), the generated columns appear to be as standard ones.

It would be great if the `DESCRIBE` function could add a section "Generated columns" reporting all the columns that are generated and their generating functions, similar to the existing "Partitioning" section.  
This could help have a better and more complete introspection power for Delta tables.

Example:
```
CREATE TABLE test(
  timestamp_utc TIMESTAMP,
  timestamp_utc_date DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (DATE(timestamp_utc))
)
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (timestamp_utc_date)
;

DESCRIBE test
;
```

Current result:
```
col_name	data_type	comment
timestamp_utc	timestamp	
timestamp_utc_date	date	
		
# Partitioning		
Part 0	timestamp_utc_date	
```

Expected result:
```
col_name	data_type	comment
timestamp_utc	timestamp	
timestamp_utc_date	date	
		
# Partitioning		
Part 0	timestamp_utc_date	

# Generated columns
timestamp_utc_date	DATE(timestamp_utc)
```
