## Feature request

### Overview

Delta should provide the possibility to refresh the manifest files for selected partition subsets.

### Motivation

There are Delta tables where multiple writers are concurrently writing new data to separate partitions, and I would like every writer to be able to refresh only the manifests of the partitions theyâ€™re working on.

### Further details

I imagine this should work with a similar syntax: 

`deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest").where("partitionColumn = 'partition_X'")`
