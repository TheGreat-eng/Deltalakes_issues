This is a **working issue** for folks to provide feedback on the prioritization of the Delta Lake priorities spanning July to December 2022.  With the release of Delta Lake 2.0, we wanted to take the opportunity to discuss other vital features for prioritization with the community based on the feedback from the Delta Users [Slack](https://go.delta.io/slack), [Google Groups](https://go.delta.io/groups), Community AMAs (on [Delta Lake YouTube](https://go.delta.io/youtube)), the [Roadmap 2022H2 (discussion)](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1307), and more.

> Note, tasks that are crossed out (i.e., ~00~) have been completed.

> To review the Delta Rust roadmap only, please refer to [https://go.delta.io/rust-roadmap](https://go.delta.io/rust-roadmap) for more information. 

## Priority 0
We will focus on these issues and continue to deliver parts (or all of the issue) over the next six months
