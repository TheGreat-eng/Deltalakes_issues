## Feature request

### Overview

Currently, the `MERGE` command returns an empty result. It would be more useful if it returned
- number of affected rows (Long)
- number of updated rows (Long)
- number of deleted rows (Long)
- number of inserted rows (Long)

### Motivation

These are obvious metrics that users would expect from this operation.

### Further details

Implementation wise, this should be pretty straight forward. We already have access to
- `metrics("numTargetRowsUpdated")`
- `metrics("numTargetRowsDeleted")`
- `metrics("numTargetRowsInserted")`
- `num_affected_rows` should just be the sum of the 3 above metrics

Remember to add tests!
