Delta 1.1.0 staged JAR is failing integration tests with error `java.lang.AssertionError: unsafe symbol JsonRawValue (child of package annotate) in runtime reflection universe`.

Further investigation has led to realizing that Delta 1.0.0 does have `org.codehaus.jackson` as a runtime dependency, but our staged Delta 1.1.0 does not.
