Since Delta will soon support **startingVersion** and **startingTimestamp** in stream source I would find it useful to have the option of **endingVersion** - similar to endingOffsets in [Kafka streams](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-kafka-integration.html).

My use case:
I'd like to downstream all increments from source Delta until the specified commit version. When the commit version is reached, the stream will be terminated.

This feature would give us interesting downstream view of "what has been commited to delta yesterday ?"
Also offering an alternative to `Trigger.Once()`, where `maxFilesPerTrigger/maxBytesPerTrigger` is ignored and all data is processed in a single batch.  Using **endingVersion** would have the same result as `Trigger.Once()` in a resource-controlled streaming fashion (honoring maxFilesPerTrigger and maxBytesPerTrigger).
