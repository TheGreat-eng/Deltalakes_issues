## Feature request

I'm looking at a way to get the last table version consumed by a client, the one that is somehow stored in checkpoints. Is there a proper API to do it ?

### Overview

Currently the way I found to get the last table version consumed by a consumer is to directly read a file stored in the checkpoints directory and then unmarshal the json and get the `reservoirVersion` column, which is the needed version.
I would like to use a proper API to get this version, passing the checkpointLocation as parameter.

### Motivation

We're working on a complex way to automate table schema mutation on delta lake.
There's a step where we need to set the version by using `startingVersion` parameter to overpass an exception due to schema change. This feature would allow to get the last version consumed by a consumer.
