## Bug
Delta Standalone 3.0.0rc1 shades Delta Storage 3.0.0rc1 and also depends on it at compile time.
It causes the issue, because a 3rd party project dependent on Delta Standalone has two sets of Delta Storage classes.

### Describe the problem

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Unzip [delta-standalone_2.12-3.0.0rc1.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-standalone_2.12/3.0.0rc1/delta-standalone_2.12-3.0.0rc1.jar) to check that storage classes are there.
2. Check that [delta-standalone_2.12-3.0.0rc1.pom](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-standalone_2.12/3.0.0rc1/delta-standalone_2.12-3.0.0rc1.pom) has Delta Storage dependency.

#### Observed results

Comparison of Delta Standalone 0.6.0 and Delta Standalone 3.0.0rc1

#### Expected results

Delta Standalone shades Delta Storage **OR** Delta Standalone depends on Delta Storage
