## Description
Right now, the Delta protocol for Row tracking references the DomainMetadata table feature, but does not explicitly state domainMetadata as one of its required table feature like e.g. Clusteredtable.  The code in `TableFeature.scala` accurately lists domainMetadata as one of the required table feature. 

This PR amends the Protocol to accurately reflect the state of the system and the remainder of the Row tracking proposition. Row Tracking cannot require writers to write DomainMetadata if it is not listing domainMetadata as one of its required feature. This is also to be consistent with how other table features handle listing their required table features.
