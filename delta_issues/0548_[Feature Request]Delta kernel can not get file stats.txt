## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [✓] Kernel

### Overview

Since the delta-standalone has been deprecated, we are migrating out project using delta-kernel instead of delta-standalone.
But we found that delta-kernel can not get file stats when scanning file lists.

In delta-standalone, we can get file stats in this class : <class AddFile implements FileAction>. And we can get the change logs
using "Iterator<VersionLog> getChanges" in io.delta.standalone.DeltaLog which can not be list in delta-kernel too.

### Motivation


- out project need min&max stats of each file to do some optimization
- the change logs will be used to maintain the file list cache incremental(since we can not list all file each time we scanning this table)

### Further details

### Willingness to contribute

- [✓] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.
