Adds drop feature support for InCommitTimestamps. When the user runs DROP FEATURE, the following will happen if ICT is present in the PROTOCOL:
1. If any of the ICT-related properties are present, the first commit will:
   - Set `IN_COMMIT_TIMESTAMPS_ENABLED` = true
   - Remove `IN_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_ENABLEMENT_VERSION` and `IN_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_ENABLEMENT_TIMESTAMP`
2. A second commit will remove ICT from the protocol.

2. When ICT is enabled in some commit after 0.
3.  Dropping when the feature is not there in protocol
4. Dropping when only one provenance property is present and even the enablement property is not present
5. Dropping when none of the table properties are present
