## Description

Make DeltaSQLTestUtils use a default prefix for temporary directories that contains special chars and provides test coverage for URL-encoding of paths. In addition, update all Delta suites to inherit from DeltaSQLTestUtils instead of SQLTestUtils to use the temp dir overrides.

Finally, update a bunch of tests to correctly handle tests with special chars. A number of tests require further investigation and potential code fixes and will be handled in follow-up commits.
