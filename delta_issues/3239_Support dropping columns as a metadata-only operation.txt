## Description

This PR proposes to support ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN as a metadata-only operation in Delta. No changes needed for the underlying Parquet files. This is only supported for Delta tables that enable column mapping. With column mapping, if a new column with the same name is added later, it won't be confused with the dropped column because the new column will have a different *physical* name than the one being dropped.

Note that there is no way to physically delete the dropped column from Parquet right now. This will be addressed as future work.

This PR partially addresses issue  #1064.
