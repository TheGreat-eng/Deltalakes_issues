## Bug

### Describe the problem
Inserting data into an existing table behaves differently when using SQL vs python/scala and when using `saveAsTable` vs. `insertInto`.

If the ingested data uses a type that is different from the type of the column in the table, inserting using`saveAsTable` in python/scala fails where alternative ways to insert the data succeed:
- SQL INSERT by position: succeeds
- SQL INSERT by name: succeeds
- Python/scala insert by position (insertInto): succeeds
- Python/scala insert by name (saveAsTable): fails.

#### Steps to reproduce

Using python:

Create table with type `int`
```
(
  spark.createDataFrame([[1]], "value: int")
    .write
    .mode("append")
    .format("delta")
    .saveAsTable("append_by_name_cast")
)
```

Append data as `long` using `saveAsTable` - fails:
```
(
  spark.createDataFrame([[2]], "value: long")
    .write
    .mode("append")
    .format("delta")
    .saveAsTable("johan_lasperas.playground.append_by_name_cast")
)
AnalysisException: Failed to merge fields 'value' and 'value'
```

Append data as `long` using `insertInto` - succeeds:
```
(
  spark.createDataFrame([[2]], "value: long")
    .write
    .mode("append")
    .format("delta")
    .insertInto("johan_lasperas.playground.append_by_name_cast")
)
```
Append data as `long` using SQL INSERT by position - succeeds:
```
INSERT INTO johan_lasperas.playground.append_by_name_cast VALUES (CAST(3 AS LONG))
```

Append data as `long` using SQL INSERT by name - succeeds:

```
INSERT INTO johan_lasperas.playground.append_by_name_cast (value) VALUES (CAST(4 AS LONG))
```
#### Observed results

Appending data with saveAsTable using a different type than the type of the column in a table fails. It should succeed
