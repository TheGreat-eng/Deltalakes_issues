Cherry-pick of d36623f0819a3b9a7e9ff924bb1faa4e9caf6050 for branch-2.4

## Description

There was an edge case in streaming with deletion vectors in the source, where in `ignoreChanges`-mode it could happen that if the same file occurred with different DVs in the same batch (or both with a DV and without a DV), then we would read the file with the wrong DV, since we broadcast the DVs to the scans by data file path.

This PR fixes this issue, by reading files from different versions in different scans and then taking the union of the result to build the final `DataFrame` for the batch.

## How was this patch tested?

Added new tests for having 2 DML commands (DELETE->DELETE and DELETE->INSERT) in the same batch for all change modi.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
