### Describe the problem

The implementation of V2 Checkpoint has a few inconsistencies with the Delta Spec (Thanks to @ebyhr for pointing this out). It does not write some fields in the V2 Checkpoint-related actions:
1. `flavor` in checkpointMetadata action [Spec Link](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/8639c411890a5c77386f04e2282fcf4caa401eff/PROTOCOL.md?plain=1#L676)
2. `type` in sidecar action [Spec Link](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/8639c411890a5c77386f04e2282fcf4caa401eff/PROTOCOL.md?plain=1#L654)
3. Also, the specification requires that the sidecarâ€™s relative file path should be specified under the field `fileName` in the sidecar action. But the implementation writes this under the field name `path`.

Given that V2 Checkpoints have not been out for long, we should update the PROTOCOL to match the implementation.
