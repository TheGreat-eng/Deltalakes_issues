### Overview
Currently, the `Column` expression refers to the column by name, but there is no way to refer to nested columns. There arefew ways to handle this:
* Introduce a `subfield` expression. `subfield(column(a),b)` refers to `a.b`
* Make the `String name` to `String[] names` in the `Column` to refer to a column as a path. To refer to `a.b`, `Column` will have `names=["a", "b"]. This is similar to Spark DSv2 expressions.
* Concatenate the nested column path entries with `.` and specify in the `Column.name`. It is the responsibility of the expression evaluator to handle the parsing. This needs to take care of escaping the `.` in the field name.
