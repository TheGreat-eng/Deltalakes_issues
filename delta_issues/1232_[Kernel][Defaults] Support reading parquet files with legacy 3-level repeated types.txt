## Description
When legacy mode is enabled in Spark, array physical types are stored slightly different from the standard format.

Standard mode (default):
```
optional group readerFeatures (LIST) {
  repeated group list {
    optional binary element (STRING);
  }
}
```

When write legacy mode is enabled (`spark.sql.parquet.writeLegacyFormat = true`):
```
optional group readerFeatures (LIST) {
  repeated group bag {
    optional binary array (STRING);
  }
}
```

TODO: We need to handle the 2-level lists. Will post a separate PR. The challenge is with generating or finding the Parquet files with 2-level lists.
