## Description

Fix time travel utility method for ICT.

DeltaHistoryManager modified the in-commit-timestamp to custom values for testing specific scenarios. This is done by getting the delta file from the snapshot's logsegment and modifying its content.

Sometimes the Snapshot might be pointing to UUID files - in such cases we should also modify the timestamp in backfilled commit.json file.
