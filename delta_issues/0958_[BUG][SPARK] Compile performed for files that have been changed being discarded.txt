## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?


- [ x] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem
When the working of methods within a class are modified, these classes are not included in the build/sbt compile step, these classes are shown as discarded.Any help on this would be heavily appreciated


#### Steps to reproduce

1.Clone or download the repo and perform extraction if need be.
2.In terminal navigate to the project directory.
3.Perform build/sbt compile.
4.Observe logs saying those classes have been discarded.

#### Observed results

Discarding class: io/delta/tables/DeltaTable.class
Discarding class: io/delta/tables/DeltaMergeMatchedActionBuilder.class
Discarding class: io/delta/tables/DeltaMergeMatchedActionBuilder$.class
Discarding class: io/delta/tables/DeltaOptimizeBuilder.class
Discarding class: io/delta/tables/DeltaOptimizeBuilder$.class
Discarding class: io/delta/tables/DeltaColumnBuilder.class

I am currently tweaking DeltaTable.class, the code has no errors and these are not the only classes being discarded and the corresponding delta-spark jar is not produced. The jar however is produced on running build/sbt package but does not contain the changes made.
