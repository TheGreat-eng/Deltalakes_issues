## Description

Currently, the `PostCommitHook::run` method is taking in a `Seq[Action]`. This means the actions must be materialized in memory before passing to this method, which may cause OOM for commit with a large number of actions. This PR changes the type to be an `Iterator[Action]` instead to allow future optimizations where the Actions are read from file on demand.

This change also prompts a change in `GenerateSymlinkManifest` to make sure that the iterator is only used once. Some test refactoring for `DeltaGenerateSymlinkManifestSuite` is also included
