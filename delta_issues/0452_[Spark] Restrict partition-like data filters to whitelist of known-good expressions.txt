## Description
Currently, we try to rewrite any arbitrary expression as partition-like. To avoid having to repeatedly remove known-bad expressions, start with a whitelist (to be expanded) of known-good expressions that can safely be rewritten. 

This change will fix an existing issue where partition-like filters are generated for a non-skipping eligible column. This partition-like filter will throw an analysis exception because these referenced columns aren't found in the stats. This issue was originally missed (and is a difference in behavior vs. partition filters) because partitioning isn't allowed on non-atomic types (or string types), so we missed adding this additional match.

## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
