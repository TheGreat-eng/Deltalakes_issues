## Description
Currently when rewriting the scan `PreprocessTablesWithDVs`, we use the `Scan` relation output as the data output for `HadoopFsRelation`. Data output comes directly from the data file or data file reader. Scan output contains additional columns such as `_metadata` which are populated in Scan operator once the data is read from the file reader.

## How was this patch tested?
Added a test. Also added a golden table for partitioned tables with DVs and tests.
