## Description

S3 has been strongly consistent (for `GET`, `PUT`, `LIST`) for years ([announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/)), yet the `S3SingleDriverLogStore` has had code that assumes S3 is read-after-write inconsistent.

This PR removes such redundant code.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing unit tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
