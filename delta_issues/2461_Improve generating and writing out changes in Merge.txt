Actual change can be seen starting from commit [Improve writing changes out in Merge](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/b1ef97991a6e00241f4ae803a3cab6ae000bea13)


This changes is part of a larger effort to improve merge performance, see https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1827

## Description
This change rewrites the way modified data is written out in merge to improve performance. `writeAllChanges` now generates a dataframe containing all the updated and copied rows to write out by building a large expression that selectively applies the right merge action to each row. This replaces the previous method that relied on applying a function to individual rows.

Changes:
- Move `findTouchedFiles` and `writeAllchanges` to a dedicated new trait `ClassicMergeExecutor` implementing the regular merge path when `InsertOnlyMergeExecutor` is not used.
- Introduce methods in `MergeOutputGeneration` to transform the merge clauses into expressions that can be applied to generate the output of the merge operation (both main data and CDC data).

## How was this patch tested?
This change fully preserve the behavior of merge which is extensively tested in `MergeIntoSuiteBase`, `MergeIntoSQLSuite`, `MergeIntoScalaSuite`, `MergeCDCSuite`, `MergeIntoMetricsBase`, `MergeIntoNotMatchedBySourceSuite`.
