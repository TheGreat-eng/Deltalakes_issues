### Motivation

I think we need to improve it before it becomes out of control.

### Further details

Parallel tests are disabled:

```
    // Don't execute in parallel since we can't have multiple Sparks in the same JVM
    Test / parallelExecution := false,
```

Do we have any alternatives?
