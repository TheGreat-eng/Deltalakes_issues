The docs here correctly state that enabling Default Columns will prevent older versions without the Default Column feature from reading the table: https://docs.delta.io/3.1.0/delta-default-columns.html
The PROTOCOL doc conflicts with the above. I tested and confirmed that Default Columns is a table feature that requires the reader to support.
