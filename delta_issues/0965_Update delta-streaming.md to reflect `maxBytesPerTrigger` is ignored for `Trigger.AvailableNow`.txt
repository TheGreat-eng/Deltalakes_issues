## Description
`maxBytesPerTrigger` is currently ignored for streaming delta table reads when using `Trigger.Once` (see https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/843) `Trigger.Once` is now deprecated in favor of `Trigger.AvailableNow` (https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/66b1f79b72855af35351ff995492f2c13872dac5). Based on my testing this behavior is carried over to `AvailableNow` as well. If this is indeed correct and expected behavior then this PR updates the docs. If this is not correct then this is an issue to be resolved and the PR should be rejected.

## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No. Docs only
