## Description
Add support for `merge` for Delta Connect Server and Scala Client.

The previous [PR](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3580) got reverted since Delta Spark Master testing was broken and Delta Connect's `DeltaMergeBuilder` was forgotten to be added. 

The `isSchemaEvolution` API was also supposed to be added for Delta Connect in that PR to have feature parity with Delta Classic Scala/Python Client.

## How was this patch tested?
Added UTs, tested locally with a checkpoint of Spark Master, the point of time before the Spark commits that broke Delta Spark Master tests were introduced.
<!--
If tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to test the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.
If the changes were tested in any way other than unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step (ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future).
If the changes were not tested, please explain why.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
This PR allows users to do MERGE on Delta Connect (Delta over Spark Connect), so anything that users are able to do with MERGE normally should also be possible with Spark Connect.

<!--
If yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.
If possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.
If no, write 'No'.
