## Description
This change adds finer-grained of individual MERGE steps (`findTouchedFiles`, `writeAllChanges`, `writeInsertsOnlyWhenNoMatchedClauses`) by recording additional merge sub-operations.
The helper method `recordMergeOperation` is improved to include an operation type.

## How was this patch tested?
Adding tests to check tracking works as expected for upserts and insert only merges.
