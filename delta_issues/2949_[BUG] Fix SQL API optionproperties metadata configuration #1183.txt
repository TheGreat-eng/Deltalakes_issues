## Description
Validation of properties now deletes the prefix `option.` in `deltaLog.snapshot.metadata.configuration` elements. This behavior is executed only if the flag `legacy.storeOptionsAsProperties`is not activated, otherwise it will still behave like it was previously.
Resolves #1183 

## How was this patch tested?
The previous test was modified to accept the new logic with and without the flag `legacy.storeOptionsAsProperties` activated. The result table was updated to make it easier to see the results expected.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
