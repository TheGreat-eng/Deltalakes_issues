## Description

This PR makes CommitInfo depend on AbstractCommitInfo. This lets us remove the `CoordinatedCommitsUtils.convertCommitInfoToAbstractCommitInfo` method.

Also cleans up code along the way, and adds `version` (read from the file name) to CommitInfo.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing UTs.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
