## Feature request

### Overview
Adding the possibility of setting the collation (specifies how data is sorted and compared) for a Delta Table

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

### Motivation
All database systems have the possibility to set the collation for a table (or the whole database). Now the data is always case and accent sensitive in a delta table. In most cases, the casing isn't relevant in comparisons (especially in analytics scenarios), and you don't want to constantly wrap your strings with upper or lower casting.
