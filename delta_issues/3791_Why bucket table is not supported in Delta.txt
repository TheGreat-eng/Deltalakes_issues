Why bucket table is not supported in Delta? I have implemented bucket table in Delta, includes
1. create a bucket table using delta
2. convert a bucket table to delta
3. read and insert, update/delete/merge on bucket delta table via SQL
4. bucket join (without shuffle)

Do we need this feature? I can file a PR.
