## Feature request

### Overview

We have lots of use cases that require fast query access to DeltaLake which doesn't seem to scale very much. Reading through the databricks documentation below it looks like the dynamic file pruning feature is what we want to leverage. However, this isn't available in Delta Lake open source.

### Motivation
