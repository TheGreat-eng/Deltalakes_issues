### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
Support for categorical / enum / dictionary data type in delta tables and spark dataframes. This seems to be generally possible with parquet. Example data types: Arrow (Dictionary), pandas (categorical), duckdb (enum).

### Motivation

This would be useful to save space for large tables with low-cardinality columns, while also achieving simplicity by not having to create a separate dimension table and a PK - FK relationship just for a couple of value mapping.
