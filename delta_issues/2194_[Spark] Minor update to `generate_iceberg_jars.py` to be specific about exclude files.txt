## Description
The script `generate_iceberg_jars.py` breaks the build if the delta source is cloned in a directory with the name `source` or `opensource`. Update the script to be specific about the files to exclude (it should be `sources.jar`).

## How was this patch tested?
Ran `build/sbt clean publishM2` successfully after deleting the `icebergShaded/libs` folder and was able to see the generated libs.
