## Bug

### Describe the problem
Filtering dates don't include the last/first date in the range. 
#### Steps to reproduce
```
CREATE TABLE default.test_delta
(
    id       Int,
    birthday date
) using delta 
location '...';
```
```
insert into table default.test_delta
values (1, cast("1999-01-01" as date));
insert into table default.test_delta
values (2, cast("1994-01-01" as date));
insert into table default.test_delta
values (3, cast('1994-04-01' as date));
insert into table default.test_delta
values (4, cast('1999-02-10' as date));
```

```
select * from default.test_delta
where birthday >= to_date('1994-01-01') and birthday < to_date('1999-02-11');
```

#### Observed results

3 rows are returned, with 1994-04-01, 1994-01-01 and 1999-01-01

#### Expected results

4 rows are returned, with 1994-04-01, 1994-01-01, 1999-02-10 and 1999-01-01

#### Further details

If increase filter condition to 
`select * from default.test_delta where birthday >= to_date('1994-01-01') and birthday < to_date('1999-02-12');`
all 4 rows are returned
