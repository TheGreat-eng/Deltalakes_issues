## Feature request

### Overview

Currently reading CDF in a batch fashion is completely blocked on column mapping enabled tables, it is understood that since Delta uses the latest snapshot schema to read historical CDC batches, and with the abilities to drop and rename columns via column mapping, the latest schema might not have been compatible with the past data batches anymore. 

However, it would be great at least for now to enable CDF batch read for folks that have not used drop or rename but with column mapping enabled to, for example, use arbitrary column names. 

### Motivation

To enable some use cases of CDC batch query for column mapping enabled tables without violating the latest schema read constraint.

### Further details

After this PR, if a user has not renamed/dropped column, reading CDC batch query should not have any problems.
