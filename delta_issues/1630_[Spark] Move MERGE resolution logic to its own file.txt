## Description
Move `resolveReferencesAndSchema` that implements the core resolution logic for Delta MERGE INTO command from package `catalyst` to `delta`. `deltaMerge` should only contain plan node definition but grew over time to accumulate all of the MERGE resolution logic. We'll eventually want to split this logic into smaller, more maintainable units.

## How was this patch tested?
This a plain refactor moving code around.
