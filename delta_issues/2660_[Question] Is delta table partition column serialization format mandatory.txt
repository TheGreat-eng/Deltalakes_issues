I found the partition column serialization format is recommended in [delta protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#partition-value-serialization). I'm trying to understand if the format is mandatory for delta table? For example, if I serialized a Date partition column with format "MM/dd/yyyy" rahter than the recommended "yyyy-MM-dd", would it be considered as an invalid delta table (for now and in future)?
