## Description

Includes all the necessary changes so that we run the python tests for our spark master build.

The delta connect python code changes can be viewed here: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3535/commits/5c608fa108dacffe47cfb93ea9eeeda5080ea357
- Note the changes in `tables.py` includes checking for the Spark version before doing any imports
```
        if (sparkSession.version.split(".")[0] == "4"):
            # Delta Connect is only supported in Delta 4.0+ on Spark 4.0+
            # Only import if using Delta/Spark 4.0+ since the import fails without grpc installed
            from pyspark.sql.connect.session import SparkSession as RemoteSparkSession

            if isinstance(sparkSession, RemoteSparkSession):
                from delta.connect.tables import DeltaTable as RemoteDeltaTable
                return RemoteDeltaTable.forPath(sparkSession, path, hadoopConf)
```


## How was this patch tested?

CI jobs pass and checked for tests run.

You can also see this PR + the delta connect python code here https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3535.

See PR here to verify the python tests pass: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3571 (since Spark master scala tests are currently failing)
