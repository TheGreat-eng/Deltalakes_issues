Currently, when Deletion Vectors are enabled we disable predicate pushdown and splitting in scans. This is because we rely on a custom row index column which is constructed in the executors and cannot not handle splits and predicates. These restrictions can now be lifted by relying instead on `metadata.row_index` which was exposed recently after relevant [work](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37980) was concluded.

Overall, this PR adds predicate pushdown and splits support as follows:

1. Replaces `__delta_internal_is_row_deleted` with `_metadata.row_index`.
2. Adds a new implementation of `__delta_internal_is_row_deleted` that is based on `_metadata.row_index`.
3. `IsRowDeleted` filter is now non deterministic to allow predicate pushdown.

Furthermore, it includes previous relevant [work](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2576) to remove the UDF from `IsRowDeleted` filter.
