## Description

This is a follow-up to the previous attempt to handle double-filtering of non-deterministic conditions (e.g. rand() < 0.25) in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4095.

It prevented non-deterministic filters from appearing in `unusedFilters` in the `ScanReport` unless we added special pipelining for them from `PrepareDeltaScan` to `filesForScan`.

This is also inconsistent with how we skip `subqueryFilters`. We now treat `filesForScan` as the narrow waist to skip any filters.
