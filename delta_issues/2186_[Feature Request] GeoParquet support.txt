### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

We are hoping to save geo data such as polygons in Delta Lake.

### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->

Currently [Apache Sedona](https://github.com/apache/sedona) which can help Spark read geo data from files such as GeoParquet, Shapefile, CSV (WKT, WKB formats).

[GeoParquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet) just released formal 1.0.0 version. 

It would be great to support GeoParquet, which can make it easy to save geo data such as polygons and potentially later query by Spark through Apache Sedona. Thanks! ðŸ˜ƒ
