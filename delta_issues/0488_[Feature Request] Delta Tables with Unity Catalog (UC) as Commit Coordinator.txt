### Overview

Implementation of Delta tables with Unity Catalog (UC) as the Commit Coordinator. This feature enables UC to act as the commit coordinator for Delta tables, providing atomic commit operations and seamless integration between Delta tables and Unity Catalog. The system will use UC as the commit coordinator when `delta.coordinatedCommits.commitCoordinator{-preview}` is set to `unity-catalog` in the Delta table properties.

### Motivation

How will this feature be used?
- Delta tables will use Unity Catalog as the central commit coordinator
- UC will maintain table metadata and track unbackfilled commits
- UC will ensure atomic commits and handle commit conflicts

Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it?

- Centralizes commit coordination through UC
- See [Delta Coordinated Commits RFC](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/protocol_rfcs/managed-commits.md) or [PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) for more information on the coordinated commits and its benefits.
