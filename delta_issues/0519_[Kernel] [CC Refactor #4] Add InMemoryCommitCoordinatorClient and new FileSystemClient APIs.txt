## Description

Add new `InMemoryCommitCoordinatorClient` used for testing. Note: this is not yet tested. That will come later. This is the exact same client test implementation as in delta-storage, but this doesn't use hadoop or logstore and instead uses the engine APIs. Note that the underlying engine of course needs to correctly implement those APIs.

Adds new `FileSystemClient` APIs, like `getFileStatus`, `exists`, `copy`

## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. See above.
