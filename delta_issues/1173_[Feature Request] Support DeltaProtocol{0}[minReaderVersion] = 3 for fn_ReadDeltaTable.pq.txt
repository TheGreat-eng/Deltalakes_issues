### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
We are using fn_ReadDeltaTable to read data from Datalake to Power BI. Recently the Databrick is upgraded and the data generated become version 3. Therefore the data are not reading in because below line of code:

`#"Validate ReaderVersion" = if DeltaProtocol{0}[minReaderVersion] <= 2 then #"Renamed ComplexTypes" else error Error.Record("DeltaLakeVersionNotSupported", "This Connector currently only supports DeltaLake tables up to version 2.", "minReaderVersion"),`

By changing the "2" to "3" all the data reads correctly again. But I are not sure it is the right thing to do.

### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->
In the future there will be more and more users upgrade to new version. It would be beneficial to every users of fn_ReadDeltaTable.pq
