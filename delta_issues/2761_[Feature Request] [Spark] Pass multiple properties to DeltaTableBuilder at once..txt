## Feature request

### Overview

When creating a new Delta Lake table with [DeltaTableBuilder](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/python/index.html#delta.tables.DeltaTableBuilder), users can specify a table property via `property`. This issue is to allow for multiple configurations to be passed at once.

### Motivation

Before this feature, users who want to add multiple properties to their Delta Lake table at time of creation have to do so manually in their application logic [(for example)](https://github.com/christophergrant/delta-hydro/blob/ba9259db04e7a94144b2f5bce8f879d03d1e9ae0/hydro/delta.py#L249), which is unnecessarily cumbersome.

### Further details

[addColumn](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/python/index.html#delta.tables.DeltaTableBuilder.addColumn) : [addColumns](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/python/index.html#delta.tables.DeltaTableBuilder.addColumns) would be roughly the same as [property](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/python/index.html#delta.tables.DeltaTableBuilder.property) : `properties`, where `properties` is the feature that this issue is proposing.

This would be a functionality for both Scala and Python.
