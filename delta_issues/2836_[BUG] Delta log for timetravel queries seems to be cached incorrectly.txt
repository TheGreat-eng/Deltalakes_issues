## Bug

### Describe the problem

When joining two different versions from the same table, produced result is incorrect.

#### Steps to reproduce

Given the following table:

```
-- create version 0
create table dev_george_t.bug_table using delta as
select 1L as colA, 'abc' as colB

-- insert version 1
insert into dev_george_t.bug_table
select 2L as colA, 'cde' as colB
```

Running `describe history dev_george_t.bug_table` outputs 2 rows (version 0 and version 1) as expected. Now let's create two views:

```
create or replace temporary view a as select * from dev_george_t.bug_table version as of 0;
create or replace temporary view b as select * from dev_george_t.bug_table version as of 1;
```

Finally, let's join them:

```
select b.* from b left join a as a on a.colA = b.colA where a.colA is null
```

Now let's materialize view `a` and run the query against it instead:

```
create table dev_george_t.bug_a using delta as select * from a
select b.* from b left join dev_george_t.bug_a as a on a.colA = b.colA where a.colA is null
```

#### Observed results

Both views:

| colA  | colB  |
|---|---|

View and a table:

| colA  | colB  |
|---|---|
| 2  | cde  |

#### Expected results
Both cases:

| colA  | colB  |
|---|---|
| 2  | cde  |

#### Further details

This has been confirmed on OSS delta, haven't tried on databricks one.

Same issue occurs if CTEs are used instead of temporary views. If either/both versions are materialized in a separate table, then join returns correct result.

### Environment information

* Delta Lake version: 2.1.1
* Spark version: 3.3.1
* Scala version: N/A
