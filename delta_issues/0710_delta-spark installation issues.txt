I am installing Apache SPARK for the first time. I was able to install the docker container.

I ran the following command:

docker pull apache/spark and then started the container using

docker run -it apache/spark /bin/sh

Now I am trying to install the delta spark package.

Used the following command

pip install delta-spark

However I am getting the following error: ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/spark' Check the permissions.
