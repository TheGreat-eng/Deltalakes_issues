Hello,

I am developing a reader for parsing Delta Logs in Python (without Spark as a dependency). The protocol document [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) is very useful, but it does say "THIS IS AN IN-PROGRESS DRAFT". However, based on the protocol records created by Delta tables, it appears there have been two versions (1, 2) of the Delta Protocol already released. Is that correct?

If I am understanding this correctly, I think it would be helpful to have final version of the protocol for each released version, so that alternative connectors can know how to support the protocol. For example, I don't have a clear picture on what changed from V1 to V2.
