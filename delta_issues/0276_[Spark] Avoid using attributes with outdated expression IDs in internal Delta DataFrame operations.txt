## Description

Avoid using attributes with outdated expression IDs in internal Delta DataFrame operations.

In this example:
```
val resolvedPlan = Dataset.ofRows(spark, LocalRelation(statsDataSchema)).select(to_json(statsCollection.statsCollector)).queryExecution.analyzed
```

the Analyzer might regenerate expression IDs (this is an implementation-specific behavior), and `statsDataSchema` may not be used along with `resolvedPlan.expressions.head`, because they will have different expression IDs associated with those expression trees. It would be correct to use `resolvedPlan.children.head.output` from that `LocalRelation`.

The issue might happen later when these attributes are passed to `DeltaJobStatisticsTracker` -> `DeltaTaskStatisticsTracker` -> `JoinedProjection.bind` along with the resolved `to_json(statsCollection.statsCollector)` expression.

The issue was found during single-pass Analyzer development, because single-pass Analyzer aggressively regenerates expression IDs, and fixed-point Analyzer preserves expression IDs for this simple DF transformation.
