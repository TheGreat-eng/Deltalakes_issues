## Description

This PR is part of https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1959

In this PR, we introduce the `GenerateIdentityValues` UDF used for populating Identity Column values. The UDF is not used in Delta in this PR yet.

`GenerateIdentityValues` is a simple non-deterministic UDF which keeps a counter with the user specified `start` and `step`. It counts in increments of `numPartitions` so that it can be parallelized in different tasks.

## How was this patch tested?
New test suite and unit tests for the UDF.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No.
