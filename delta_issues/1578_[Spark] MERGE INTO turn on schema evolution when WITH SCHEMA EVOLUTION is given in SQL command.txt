## Description

This PR teaches the `MERGE INTO` command to turn on schema evolution when there exists `WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION` keywords in the commands.

Changes in this PR are:

1. Modify case classes `MergeIntoCommand` and `DeltaMergeInto` to store schema evolution enablement information.
2. For `DeltaMergeInto`, we reuse the existing migrateSchema fields instead of adding a new one.
3. Scala user-facing `DeltaMergeBuilder` API.

Changed to be done but not in this PR:

1. Python user-facing DeltaMergeBuilder API.
2. Extend schema evolution tests to test `WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION` keywords.

## How was this patch tested?

Improving the existing tests.



## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

This PR allows user to turn on automatic scheme evolution for a specific MERGE command by issuing `MERGE WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION INTO ...` SQL commands.
