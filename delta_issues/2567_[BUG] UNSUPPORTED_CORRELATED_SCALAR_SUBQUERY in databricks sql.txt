## Bug

UNSUPPORTED_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY 

### Describe the problem
The below function in Databricks gives UNSUPPORTED_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY error. We didn't have this issue though in Oracle. Is this a limitation of Databricks? Just to note the final result returns only one row. Thank you in advance

 

#### Steps to reproduce

create or replace function GET_PREV_DAY(vdate DATE, vdays_bef decimal(38) DEFAULT 1) returns DATE

return

  with cte as

  ( select (t.DATE_FIELD), row_number() over (order by t.DATE_FIELD desc) rn

  from time t

  where t.DATE_FIELD = (p_date)

  and t.WORK_DAYS = 1

  ) select (cte.DATE_FIELD) as l_result from cte where rn= p_days_before;
