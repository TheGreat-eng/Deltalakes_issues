### Describe the problem
Delta 3.0 version of Kernel APIs have data type ([MixedDataType](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/internal/types/MixedDataType.java#L24)) that is not part of the spec, but was added to get around the issues with table schema encoded in JSON. More details refer [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/internal/types/MixedDataType.java#L24).

We should get rid of this class as it causes confusion on list of data type supported by the Kernel.
