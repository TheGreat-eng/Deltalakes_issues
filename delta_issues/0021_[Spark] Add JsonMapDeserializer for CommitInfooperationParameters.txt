## Description


This PR fixes an old deserialization issue in CommitInfo's operationParameters field. When deserializing, JSON strings were stored without proper escaping, causing problems during reserialization:

First Serialization:
```
"operationParameters": {
  "mode": "Append",
  "statsOnLoad": false,
  "partitionBy": "[]"
}
```

Reserialization after deserialization:
```
"operationParameters": {
  "mode": Append,
  "statsOnLoad": false,
  "partitionBy": []
}
```

`DESCRIBE HISTORY` was however relying on the old behavior. We fix it by adding a `prettyOperationParameters` method to CommitInfo which makes it a neutral change for `DESCRIBE HISTORY`
