## Description

`DeltaTableV2.snapshot` can be stale, if the object was instantiated long before the command using it. This can happen, for example, with a `DeltaTable` (which binds an internal `DeltaTableV2` when constructed and never refreshes it). This can be dangerous, so we rename the field and document the danger so it is less likely to cause bugs.

## How was this patch tested?

Field rename - compilation suffices.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
