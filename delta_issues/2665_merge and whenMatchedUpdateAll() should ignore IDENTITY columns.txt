## Feature request

### Overview

When using schema evolution having access to merge is valuable. However whenMatchedUpdateAll() doesn't ignore IDENTITY columns making the only solution manually map the specific columns.

### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->

### Further details

I suggest that the merge whenMatchedUpdate(), whenNotMatchedInsert() etc should disregard the Identity columns
