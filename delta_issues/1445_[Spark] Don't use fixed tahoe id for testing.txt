## Description

 * Do not use the literal "testId" for every single tahoeId in testing. This can hide issues where we use the wrong id (for example as key in a map).
 * Fix one of these issues with the partition stats for auto compaction, where we used a completely random tableId as the key, rather than than the tableId that commitLarge just wrote.
 * Add a (temporary) flag to not include the tahoeId in the equals and hashCode methods of TahoeLogFileIndex. Having an unstable external field there is prone to race conditions (of the form this != this) and losing instances in hash sets/maps. So ideally we should make this the default.
