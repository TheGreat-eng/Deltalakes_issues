## Bug

### Describe the problem
File stats skipping is causing two `filesForScan` operations.

#### Steps to reproduce
```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import pyspark.sql.functions as F

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

df = spark.range(5).select(F.struct(F.lit('test').alias('test'), F.col('id').cast("string").alias('id')).alias('nested'))
df.write.format('delta').save('test')

spark.read.format('delta').load('test').filter('nested.id = "2"').count()
```

#### Observed results
There are two scan stages, caused by hitting [this](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/f598157fb188daa32b1c5912ce2599feab24984e/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/stats/PrepareDeltaScan.scala#L326) line of code. Example output:

```
Prepared scan does not match actual filters. Reselecting files to query.
Prepared: ExpressionSet((nested#457.id = 2), isnotnull(nested#457))
Actual: ExpressionSet(isnotnull(nested#457), (nested#457.id = 2))
```

<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->

#### Expected results
The expression sets are the same so it shouldn't trigger a second file scan.

<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->

#### Further details
