### Overview

https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2260 implemented a feature which, to summarize, does the following: when loading the latest protocol and metadata (P & M) for a table, pass in hint which stores the P & M for the table at a particular version. When reading the log backwards, don't read past that version! Just take the P & M from the hint if you haven't found a newer P & M yet. This bounds the total amount of computation.

The feature request here is as follows: Suppose
- we are loading v100
- there is hint at version 99
- there is a `100.checkpoint.parquet`
- there is a `100.json`

Then, when we are loading the latest P & M, don't read `100.checkpoint.parquet`! Reading 100.json should be MUCH faster (much less data), and if we don't find the P & M there then we should just take it from the hint at v99.

Should we instead have some threshold of # of JSONs we would rather read than an entire parquet file?

i.e. suppose we are loading v100, we have a hint at v95. should we load v100 checkpoint? or read 100, 99, 98, 97, 96 JSONs and then just use the hint?
