## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [x] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem

I added the jars listed in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/connectors/flink to `$FLINK_HOME/lib` and am able to successfully create a catalog via Flink SQL. However, I cannot create a table as I get `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.delta.storage.LogStore`

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Set up Flink 1.16.2 with Hadoop 3.1.2 and Hive 3.1.3 as shown in Flink documentation
2. Test that the configuration works in Flink SQL client:
```
CREATE CATALOG hive WITH (
  'type' = 'hive',
  'hive-conf-dir' = '/etc/hive/conf'
);

USE CATALOG HIVE;

CREATE TABLE testh (
  id INT,
  data STRING
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'hive',         
  'path' = 'hdfs:///data/test/testh',  
  'format' = 'parquet'
);

insert into testh values (3, '4');
```
3. Add additional jars to `$FLINK_HOME/lib`:
```
delta-flink-3.0.0.jar
delta-standalone_2.12-3.0.0.jar
flink-clients-1.16.2.jar
flink-parquet-1.16.2.jar
flink-table-common-1.16.2.jar
```
4. Restart Flink:
```
sudo systemctl restart flink-jobmanager.service
sudo systemctl restart flink-taskmanager.service
```
5. Test that the configuration works in Flink SQL client:
```
create catalog dhive with (
  'type' = 'delta-catalog',
  'catalog-type' = 'hive',
  'hive-conf-dir' = '/etc/hive/conf',
  'hadoop-conf-dir' = '/etc/hadoop/conf'
);

use catalog dhive;

CREATE TABLE testd (
    id INT,
    data STRING
  )
  WITH (
    'connector' = 'delta',
	'table-path' = 'hdfs:///data/test/testd'
);

insert into testd values (1, '2');
```

#### Observed results

```
Flink SQL>
> CREATE TABLE testd (
>     id BIGINT,
>     data STRING
>   )
>   WITH (
>     'connector' = 'delta',
> 'table-path' = 'hdfs:///data/test/testd'
> );
[ERROR] Could not execute SQL statement. Reason:
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.delta.storage.LogStore
```

#### Expected results

I expected Flink SQL to create table testd and insert a single record into it.

#### Further details

I think the issue might be that delta-standalone jar doesn't actually contain io.delta.storage.LogStore, even though delta-storage is its compile dependency. It might be sensible to include the full list of jars that must be included for Flink SQL to work or to provide a fat connector jar like the one that is provided by Flink for Hive.

### Environment information
