https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1382 upgraded Spark version to 3.3.1 but it didn't upgrade PySpark version. Hence, Scala tests are running with Spark 3.3.1 but Python tests are running with Spark 3.3.0.

We need to upgrade the PySpark version in the following files:
- https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/Dockerfile
- https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yaml
