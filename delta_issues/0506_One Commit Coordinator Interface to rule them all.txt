Today there are two Commit Coordinator Client (CCC) interfaces. One in delta-kernel-api and one in delta-storage (that delta-spark uses). Further, the current DynamoDBCommitCoordinatorClient implementation uses the delta-storage CCC interface. This means that any engine that wants to re-use that same DDB-CCC implementation has to depend on delta-storage, which brings in Hadoop and LogStore dependencies. This won't work for all engines (e.g.)

We should Kernel-ize the interface and implementations and make sure that any engine can use the implementations provided in this repo.
