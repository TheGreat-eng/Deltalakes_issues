Hello,
up to now as I understand , streaming on delta table doesn't permit update and delete merges, only append ones.
It could be interesting to be able to update and delete rows too.  My use case is the following ; I've debezium which sends cdc in kafka ; I would like to stream kafka and update continuously my delta table. 
It is possible with Matereialize (https://materialize.com/materialize-under-the-hood/). for instance.
