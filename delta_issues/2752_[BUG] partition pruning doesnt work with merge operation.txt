## partition pruning doesnt work with merge operation

###  I am using version delta-core_2.12 version 2.1.0 and the partition pruning doesnt happen with merge operation.

#### Steps to reproduce

```
deltaTable.as("oldData")
        .merge(
            finalDF.where("OP != 'd'")
                    .as("newData"),
            condition = "oldData.ID = newData.ID and oldData.created_date in ('null','2022-12','2023-01')")
        .whenMatched
        .updateAll()
        .whenNotMatched
        .insertAll()
        .execute()
```

#### Observed results

In the physical plan I see no indication of partition filter being used on partition field created_date instead it ends up in the `SortMergeJoin +- SortMergeJoin [ID#43253], [ID#43121], FullOuter, created_date#43136 IN (null,2022-12,2023-01)`
