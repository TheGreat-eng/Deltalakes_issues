## Description
Building UniForm depends on cloning and then building iceberg at a particular commit, in order to apply patch files. It starts this by cloning iceberg `master` branch. This has been renamed to `main`, and so we need to update our script to use `main` accordingly, else it fails to build and tests fail.

## How was this patch tested?
Local build.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No
