It has been over 6 months since the last release of `v0.7.0` which is a considerably longer gap than in-between previous releases. I was also unable to find any information on (or an up-to-date milestone for) the release plan for `0.8`.
Is there any source of documentation around the release process or cycle for the project or can someone provide information on the release of `v0.8`?

We are interested in this release due to changes that have been merged since June, including but not limited to the performance improvements to the `vacuum` operation.
