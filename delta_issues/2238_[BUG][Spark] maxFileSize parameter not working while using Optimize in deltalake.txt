### Describe the problem
We are using delta lake optimize function with zorder to generate files of 100MB each.
For this we are using the parameter **spark.databricks.delta.optimize.maxFileSize = 104857600**, **spark.databricks.delta.targetFileSize = 104857600**
Existing parquet files in delta folder are 1MB each, after optimize the files generated are ~600MB each rather than expected 100MB.
We are using Java API.

**Note: We are using AWS EMR to run optimize with zorder.**


#### Steps to reproduce
1. Generate deltalake table with 1MB parquet files in delta folder
2. Execute optimize with zorder

#### copy-pastable code snippets
DeltaTable table = DeltaTable.forPath(path);  //path refers to S3 deltalake folder
List<String> cols = tableConfig.getzOrderColumns();   // List of columns on which zoder needs to be applied
table.optimize().where(partitionCondition).executeZOrderBy(convertListToSeq(cols));  //partition condition refers to the columns on 
which deltalake table is partitioned


#### Observed results
The optimize function is not considering the value provided in the **maxFileSize**/**targetFileSize** parameter.
Expected parquet file size in delta folder ~100MB generated file size ~600MB
<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->

#### Expected results
The optimize function should create compacted files of size which is near about the size provided by **maxFileSize**/**targetFileSize** parameter
Expected parquet file size in delta folder ~100MB generated file size ~600MB
<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->
