## Description

Spark 3.3.0 will add a new data type: [timestamp without time zone](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35662). It's a local timestamp without the time zone information.

This PR proposes the Delta Lake protocol change to support this new type. There is no implementation yet because it's blocked by Spark 3.3.0 release.

Also twist the existing doc for `timestamp` type.

## How was this patch tested?

There is no test since this is a protocol change.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. The protocol will talk about how to support Spark's new data type `timestamp without time zone`.
