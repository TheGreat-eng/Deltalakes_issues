Currently, kernel uses `get` prefix for getter method, but it will lead to inconsistent naming once we start using [record](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/language/records.html) of JDK 16. 

I propose changing the convention to avoid `get` prefix as much as possible like Iceberg project.

> 2. Avoid get in method names, unless an object must be a Java bean.
>   - In most cases, replace `get` with a more specific verb that describes what is happening in the method, like `find` or `fetch`.
>   - If there isn't a more specific verb or the method is a getter, omit `get` because it isn't helpful to readers and makes method names longer.
