Hi

Created a table all is fine.
but when I try this 

`df_history1 = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM agg VERSION AS OF 1")`

I get 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

== SQL ==
SELECT * FROM agg VERSION AS OF 1
```

working with pySpark on Spark 3.0.2 and delta lake 0.8.0.
Seems strange because all other feature works as they should 
Any idea ?
