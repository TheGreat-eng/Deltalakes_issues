The main goal of this Pull Request is to make small changes in the tests by providing very minor changes which in most cases consists of :

- removing unused imports
- removing unused values
- stop using a deprecated method and replace it by the adequate method
- replacing var by val when possible
- not using the new operator when instantiating a scala case class (like StructField or StructType)

These changes were tested by running all the tests.
