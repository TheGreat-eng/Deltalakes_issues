## Description

Previously, certain code paths assumed the existence of delta files for a specific version at a predictable path `_delta_log/$version.json`. This assumption is no longer valid with managed-commits, where delta files may alternatively be located at `_delta_log/_commits/$version.$uuid.json`. We explicitly rename the old method to `unsafeDeltaFile` to warn future users about it being incorrect for tables with Managed Commits.

To not break dependent systems, plan:
1. Update all delta-spark usages to use the unsafe method. (current PR)
2. Deprecate the deltaFile method. (current PR)
3. Remove the deprecated method once it's proven to be safe. (future PR)
