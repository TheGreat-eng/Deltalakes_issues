## Description

- Make Metadata implement AbstractMetadata
- Update kernel's AbstractMetadata to align it with delta-storage's AbstractMetadata (storage uses Long for createdTime, kerenel used Optional<Long>).
- Update kernel's AbstractMetadata to all `@Nulalble` annotations to make it clear the expected return values.
- Consolidate Metadata's getPartitionColumn APIs (there were two APIs, with different return types and different case-sensitivities; now there's only 1 API)
