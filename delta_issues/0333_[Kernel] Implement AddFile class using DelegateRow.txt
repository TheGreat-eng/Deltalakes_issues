This PR implements the `AddFile` action class, with the help of `DelegateRow` and `RowBackedAction`, which are also newly introduced in this PR. The core changes include:

`RowBackedAction`
- A new abstract base class for Delta Log actions that are backed by a `Row`. It can be extended by actions like `AddFile`, where we want to avoid materializing of all fields from action rows when creating action instances within Kernel. 

`DelegateRow`:
- A new `Row` implementation that wraps an existing `Row` and allows overriding values for some particular ordinals.
- Currently this is used to update certain fields of an action by creating a modified view of its underlying row without mutating the original row.
- The implementation ensures we only keep one layer of delegation.

`AddFile`
- This PR implements its constructor, field getters, necessary overrides, and APIs for creating a new instance with updated fields.
- It adds two fields `baseRowId` and `defaultRowCommitVersion`, which will be used for Row Tracking later.
