## Feature request

### Overview

Enable shallow cloning parquet-backed Iceberg tables following the Delta protocols without the need to copy all of the data.

### Motivation

We want to make it easier for users to read parquet-backed Iceberg tables within the context of Delta pipelines.  While #1462 enables users to convert parquet-backed Iceberg tables to Delta in place, this may interfere with existing pipeline processes.  Propose to use a `SHALLOW CLONE` to create a Delta log that points to the original files. 

### Further details

We will have to think about what this API / module / JAR / artifact, etc. will look like. Would love to hear feedback and thoughts from the community!
