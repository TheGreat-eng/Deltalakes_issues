## Description

Adds a test parallelization option to run Delta tests on different JVM addressing #1128:
- Implements a generic abstraction called `GroupingStrategy` and a default implementation `SimpleHashStrategy` that uses a fixed number of `Test.Groups` each forked in its own JVM.
- Provides two collection of settings, one that can be added to enable test parallelization, one to use the default strategy which will use 4 JVM unless separately specified by an environment variable called `DELTA_TEST_JVM_COUNT`
- Adds those two settings to the core package 

Resolves #1128 on local developer machine, but not on the CI Pipeline. 

## How was this patch tested?

Logging has been introduced using SBT logger so to get some statistics around the distribution of tests

Additionally running tops on my Macbook shows 4 JVM running as expected, all with the same Parent PID
