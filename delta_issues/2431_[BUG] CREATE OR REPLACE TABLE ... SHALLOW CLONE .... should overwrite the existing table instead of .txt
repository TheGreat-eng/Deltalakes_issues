## Bug

### Describe the problem

When the target table of SHALLOW CLONE already exists, the SHLLOW CLONE will fails for the error below even CREATE OR REPLACE is used:
```
org.apache.spark.sql.delta.DeltaIllegalStateException: The clone destination table is non-empty. Please TRUNCATE or DELETE FROM the table before running CLONE.
  at org.apache.spark.sql.delta.DeltaErrorsBase.cloneReplaceNonEmptyTable(DeltaErrors.scala:2610)
  at org.apache.spark.sql.delta.DeltaErrorsBase.cloneReplaceNonEmptyTable$(DeltaErrors.scala:2609)
  at org.apache.spark.sql.delta.DeltaErrors$.cloneReplaceNonEmptyTable(DeltaErrors.scala:2681)
  at org.apache.spark.sql.delta.commands.CloneTableBase.runInternal(CloneTableBase.scala:196)
  at org.apache.spark.sql.delta.commands.CloneTableCommand.run(CloneTableCommand.scala:106)
```
I think the expected behavior is overwriting the existing table (i.e., drop it and create a new one with the latest SHALLOW CLONE)

#### Steps to reproduce

Run the same SHALLOW CLONE commands on the same target table twice, e.g.,
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE <target> SHALLOW CLONE <source>
```
