## Description

Small fixes for determinism determination for Merge Materialize Source.
* since we consider joins as potentially non-deterministic, we should also consider correlated subqueries as such, because they essentially are also joins.
* non Delta source will not be found in subqueries in `findFirstNonDeltaScan`, but found in `findFirstNonDeterministicNode`. This will make merge source materialization give wrong reason for materialization.

## How was this patch tested?

Added tests with subqueries and nested subqueries in Project and Filters and correlated subqueries.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
