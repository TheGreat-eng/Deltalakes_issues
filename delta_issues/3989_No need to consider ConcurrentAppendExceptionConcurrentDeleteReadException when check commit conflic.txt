I have a Scenario related to Conflict check, that is when the current txn check conflict with a already committed Compaction's actions(AddFile&RemoveFile), should we need to consider ConcurrentAppendException/ConcurrentDeleteReadException?
I think there is no need to do these two Exceptions conflict check, but we should keep the last ConcurrentDeleteDeleteException in this Scenario.
Because the actions of Compation is dataChange=false, it just rerange the data, not modify it.
1. ConcurrentAppendException
the data of the new AddFile in Compaction's actions should already be read by the current txn.
2. ConcurrentDeleteReadException
the data of the RemoveFile in Compaction's actions does not be deleted, they just reranger
to other files. So it does not affect the AddFiles read by the current txn, even they deleted by Compaction.

Can any one help to review the logic? @marmbrus @zsxwing  Thanks!
If it is correct, we can reduce some conflict.
