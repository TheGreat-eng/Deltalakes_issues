## Feature request

### Overview

https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1210 allows `S3SingleDriverLogStore` to use the startAfter param for faster list logStore calls. This feature only works on S3A file systems.

We need to ensure that a `ClassCastException` is thrown when using the wrong file system during the cast, not during the first method invocation.

### Motivation

This will improve the user experience of this feature.
