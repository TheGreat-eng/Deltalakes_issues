Yes. The current drop feature command requires the execution of the command twice with a 24 hour waiting time in between. In addition, it also results in the truncation of the history of the Delta table to the last 24 hours.

We introduce a new DROP FEATURE implementation that allows to drop features instantly without truncating history. Dropping a feature introduces a new writer feature to the table, the `CheckpointProtectionTableFeature`.

Dropping a feature with the new behaviour can be achieved as follows:
`ALTER TABLE x DROP FEATURE y`

We can still drop a feature with the old behaviour as follows:
`ALTER TABLE x DROP FEATURE y TRUNCATE HISTORY`.

Finally, the CheckpointProtectionTableFeature can be dropped similarly to any other feature:
`ALTER TABLE x DROP FEATURE CheckpointProtectionTableFeatureTRUNCATE HISTORY`.
