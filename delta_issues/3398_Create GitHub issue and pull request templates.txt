Currently we don't GitHub issue and pull request templates. It would be great to add them to help Delta users report issues and contribute code.

Template examples:
- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
- https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/4.1/.github
- https://github.com/line/armeria/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
