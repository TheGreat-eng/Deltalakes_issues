## Feature request

### Overview

Delta tables schemas are currently being stored in HMS (Hive Metastore) as a single array:

col array<string>

### Motivation

Currently, when the delta tables are created from delta jar, schema are not properly updated to HMS, which leads to an issue in discovery for tables and tables' columns for  discovery for hive users.

Steps to reproduce:

```
spark-sql --packages io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.2.0 --conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"
```
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS delta_table_dwh.company_name (
  id INT,
  cname STRING
) USING DELTA 
```

HMS:
```
SELECT column_name, type_name
FROM COLUMNS_V2
WHERE CD_ID IN (
    SELECT CD_ID
    FROM SDS
    WHERE SD_ID = (
        SELECT SD_ID
        FROM TBLS
        WHERE tbl_name = 'company_name'
    )
)
ORDER BY column_name ASC;
```

Output:
```
+-------------+---------------+
| column_name | type_name     |
+-------------+---------------+
| col         | array<string> |
+-------------+---------------+
```

Expected Output:
```
+-------------+---------------+
| column_name | type_name     |
+-------------+---------------+
| cname       | string        |
| id          | bigint        |
+-------------+---------------+
```
