## Description
Currently, Kernel doesn't allow setting arbitrary table properties other than the `delta.*` properties that Kernel understands. We have valid use cases where we need to allow storing properties with arbitrary key names.

As part of this, we also don't want to set any `delta.*` properties that Kernel doesn't understand or supports yet.
