Current Delta support non-correlated scalar subquery in the UPDATE SET clause.
```sql
UPDATE target as t
SET t.value = (SELECT max(s.value) FROM source s)
```
This PR makes it to support correlated scalar subquery:
```sql
UPDATE target as t
SET t.value =
 (
   SELECT sum(s.value)
   FROM source s WHERE s.key1 = t.key2
 )
```
Without the PR, it will throw

Correlated scalar sub-queries can only be used in a Filter/Aggregate/Project and a few commands
