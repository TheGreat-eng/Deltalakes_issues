## Description

Adds a guardrail for the type widening table feature to reject reads when an unsupported change was applied to the table.
This should never happen unless an implementation doesn't respect the type widening feature specification, which explicitly lists type changes that are allowed.

## How was this patch tested?
- Added a test manually committing an invalid type change.
