### Overview

#2211 adds a test for reading empty parquet files (and fixes a bug in our `DefaultParquetReader`). We should test the same for the `DefaultJsonHandler`.

### Further details

We should test `DefaultJsonHandler.readJsonFiles(...)` with a file-list that includes empty JSON files in the middle of the list.
