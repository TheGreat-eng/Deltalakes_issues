## Description

This fixes an issue where inconsistently using case-insensitive column names with schema evolution and generated columns can trigger an assertion during analysis.
If `new_column` is a column present in the source and not the target of a MERGE operation and the target contains a generated column, the following INSERT clause will fail as `NEW_column` and `new_column` are wrongly considered different column names when computing the final schema after evolution:

```
WHEN NOT MATCHED  THEN INSERT (NEW_column) VALUES (source.new_column);
```

## How was this patch tested?
Added tests for schema evolution, generated column to cover case-(in)sensitive column names.
