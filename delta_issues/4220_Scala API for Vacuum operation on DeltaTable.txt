For issue #48 , Added Vacuum implementation in VacuumCommand.

Users can Vacuum a given DeltaTable with a given retention period. Vacuum would Recursively delete files and directories in the table that are not needed by the table for maintaining older versions up to the given retention threshold. 
Note: Vacuum would disable the ability to timetravel beyond the retention period.

Sample usage : 
`deltaTable = new DeltaTable(spark.table(tableName))`
`deltaTable.vacuum(retentionHours = 13)`
`deltaTable.vacuum()`
