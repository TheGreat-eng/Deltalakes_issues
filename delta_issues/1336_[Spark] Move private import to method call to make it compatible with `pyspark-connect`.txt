## Description

This PR proposes to move import from `from pyspark.sql.column import _to_seq ` to `from pyspark.sql.classic.column import _to_seq `

`pyspark.sql.column._to_seq` has moved to `pyspark.sql.classic.column._to_seq`, and `pyspark.sql.classic` does not exist in `pyspark-connect` package.

## How was this patch tested?

Manually tested.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, this makes `delta.tables` compatible with pure Python library `pyspark-connect` (in Spark development branch).
