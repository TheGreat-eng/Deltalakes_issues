### Describe the problem
After push extra predicate through join may produce foldable predicate like `1=1`, then cause `DataFiltersBuilder.constructDataFilters` infinite loop. 
#### Steps to reproduce
```
Seq((1, 2)).toDF("a", "b").write.format("delta").save(dir.getAbsolutePath + "/t1")
Seq(1).toDF("a").write.format("delta").save(dir.getAbsolutePath + "/t2")
Seq((1, 2)).toDF("a", "c").write.format("delta").save(dir.getAbsolutePath + "/t3")
spark.read.format("delta").load(dir.getAbsolutePath + "/t1").createTempView("t1")
spark.read.format("delta").load(dir.getAbsolutePath + "/t2").createTempView("t2")
spark.read.format("delta").load(dir.getAbsolutePath + "/t3").createTempView("t3")
spark.sql(
  """
    |select t.*,t3.a as c from
    |(
    |select * from t1
    |union all
    |select *,1 as b from t2
    |) t, t3
    |where t.a=t3.a
    |and (t.a > 1 or (t.b = 1 and t3.c=1))
    |""".stripMargin).collect()

#### Observed results
