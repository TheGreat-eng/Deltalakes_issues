## Description
Currently, we expect the path given to `Table.forPath()` to be fully qualified. This enforces an unnecessary burden on the connector to add the necessary schema or authority etc. Instead, add a `FileSystemClient.resolvePath` API and use it to resolve the path to a fully qualified path from `Table.forPath()`.

## How was this patch tested?
Existing tests (deleted the `file:` prefix added to tests tables in the path) and a couple of new tests around missing table paths.
