Hi team,

We need help understanding the purpose of S3:ListBucket operation in delta.io and how we can reduce the calls or avoid them.

We currently run spark streaming jobs  + delta with below details:

Spark: 3.0.2
Hadoop: 3.2.1
Delta: 0.8.0 

While analysing our S3 usage we noticed large number of S3:ListBucket operation which we would like to reduce. It will be helpful if you can guide us, at how to reduce them or some best practises around the same.

Let me know if you need additional details. 

Regards,
Nimesh.
