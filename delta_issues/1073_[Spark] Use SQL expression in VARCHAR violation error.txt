## Description

Small fix to use the SQL expression instead of the internal catalyst representation of an expression in the error message for a VARCHAR length constraint violation.

## How was this patch tested?

Modified an existing test

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, the error message for the class `DELTA_EXCEED_CHAR_VARCHAR_LIMIT` will use different formatting for the expression of the violated constraint. For example, the user will now see `((value IS NULL) OR (length(value) <= 12))` instead of `(isnull('value) OR (length('value) <= 12))`
