## Description
This PR is part of https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1959

In this PR, we enable basic ingestion for Identity Columns. 
* We use a custom UDF `GenerateIdentityValues` to generate values when not supplemented by the user. 
* We introduce classes to help update and track the high watermark of identity columns. 
* We also do some cleanup/ improve readability for ColumnWithDefaultExprUtils

Note: This does NOT enable Ingestion with MERGE INTO yet. That will come in a follow up PR, to make this easier to review.

## How was this patch tested?
We introduce a new test suite IdentityColumnIngestionSuite.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No.
