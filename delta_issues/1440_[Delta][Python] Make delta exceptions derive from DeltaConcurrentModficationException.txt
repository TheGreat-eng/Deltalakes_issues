## Description

Made the delta exceptions derive from DeltaConcurrentModficationException to align with what's done in Scala.
This also makes it easy to check/catch all of the delta concurrent related exceptions.
Also removed an exception conversion as the scala equivalent class is abstract meaning it can never be instantiated.

## How was this patch tested?

Shouldn't have any functional difference so will be covered by existing tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, users will now be able to catch all the delta exceptions by doing something like:
```python

try:
    delta_operation()
except delta.exceptions.DeltaConcurrentModificationException as e:
    ...
````
