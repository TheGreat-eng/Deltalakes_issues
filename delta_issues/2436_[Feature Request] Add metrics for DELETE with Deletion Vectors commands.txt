## Feature request
Left over task from the delta-io/1591.

Currently the DELETE command doesn't add any commit metrics when DVs are generated/updated.

We want at least the following two metrics to the commit info.

```
numDeletionVectorsAdded : 3
numDeletionVectorsRemoved: 3
```

These metrics will show up in 
```
DESCRIBE HISTORY delta.`path/to/table`
```
