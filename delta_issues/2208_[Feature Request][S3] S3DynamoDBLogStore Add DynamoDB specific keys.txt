### Overview

Add configuration support for DynamoDB specific access keys, such that when accessing AWS to read/write to a DynamoDB table, Delta would use the new keys instead of the `s3a` filesystem configured keys.

### Motivation

When working with S3 compatible services such as MinIO, the provided `s3a` access keys will be configured by the service and not by AWS, therefore those keys are not valid to use with DynamoDB. 
With DynamoDB specific access key configurations, this limitation is gone.
