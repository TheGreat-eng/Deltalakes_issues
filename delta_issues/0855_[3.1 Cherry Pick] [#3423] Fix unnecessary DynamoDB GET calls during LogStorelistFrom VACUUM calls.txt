## Description

Resolves #3423.

This PR updates the logic in `BaseExternalLogStore::listFrom` so that it does not make a request to get the latest entry from the external store (which is used to perform recovery operations) in the event that a non `_delta_log` file is being listed.

This is useful for VACUUM operations which may do hundreds or thousands of list calls in the table directory and nested partition directories of parquet files. This is NOT the `_delta_log`. Thus, checking the external store during these list calls is (1) useless and unwanted as we are not listing the `_delta_log` so clearly now isn't the time to attempt to do a fixup, and (2) expensive.

This PR makes it so that future VACUUM operations do not perform unnecessary calls to the external store (e.g. DyanamoDB).

## How was this patch tested?

Unit tests and an integration test that actually runs VACUUM and compares the number of external store calls using the old/new logic. I ran that test myself 50 times, too, and it passed every time (therefore, not flaky).

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
