### Overview

The spark log replay [code](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/79c848f1f555e07c5d2ff368627d1414424cbef5/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/actions/InMemoryLogReplay.scala#L87-L95) expires transaction metadata based on user configuration. Delta standalone [code](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/79c848f1f555e07c5d2ff368627d1414424cbef5/connectors/standalone/src/main/scala/io/delta/standalone/internal/actions/InMemoryLogReplay.scala#L4) has diverged and does not appear to support this functionality.
