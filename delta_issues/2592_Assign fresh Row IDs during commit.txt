## Description
This change implements assigning unique fresh Row IDs when committing files on tables that support Row Ids:
- Set the `baseRowId` field of every `add` and `remove` actions in commits.
- Generate `highWaterMark` action to update the Row ID high watermark. 
- Gracefully resolve conflicts between transactions by reassigning overlapping Row IDs before committing.

## How was this patch tested?
- Adding tests to RowIdSuite to cover assigning fresh Row IDs.
- Adding tests to CheckpointSuite to ensure `baseRowId` and `highWaterMark` information survives checkpointing.


## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No, assigning fresh row ids is hidden from users. Reading row ids will come in a follow-up PR.
Note that row ids are currently hidden behind property `spark.databricks.delta.rowIds.allowForDevOnly` to avoid leaking a partial implementation.
