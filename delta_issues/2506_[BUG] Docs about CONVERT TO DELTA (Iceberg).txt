## Bug
The https://docs.delta.io/2.3.0/delta-utility.html#convert-an-iceberg-table-to-a-delta-table incorrectly says it is available in Delta Lake 2.3. But it is available since 2.2

For some reason the compiled jar is not available in Maven: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-iceberg_2.12/, the library exists in 2.2: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/v2.2.0/delta-iceberg/src
