### Overview

(Part of #2229)

#2433 adds initial support for end-to-end data skipping. As a follow-up we should prune the stats read schema to only include the fields that are used by the generated filter.

### Motivation

Lower the parsing/reading overhead. If we only use a small subset of the stats columns (very likely) we shouldn't read all of them.
