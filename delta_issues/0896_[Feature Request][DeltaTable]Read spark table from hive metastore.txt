### Overview

It's not possible to read dataframes save with .saveAsTable spark method.

### Motivation

It's more suitable to read spark tables not from storage like HDFS or S3 directry.

### Further details

Delta table declaration method from here supports only path table registration https://docs.delta.io/0.4.0/api/python/index.html. It's not suitable for delta tables saved with .saveAsTable spark method which registers table in hive metastore and allows to read delta table with spark.table method.
