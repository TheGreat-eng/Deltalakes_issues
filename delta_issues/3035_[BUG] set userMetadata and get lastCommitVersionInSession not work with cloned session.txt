## Bug

### Describe the problem

Trying to get lastCommitVersionInSession  in a thread safe way. So cloned a new session in thread.

But it only works in databricks, not with open source delta 1.2.1

#### Steps to reproduce

Test code is copied from workaround in issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/857

```
session_clone = spark.newSession()
session_clone.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.commitInfo.userMetadata", "metadata message")
val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(session_clone, somePath)
deltaTable.merge(...).update(...).insert(...).execute()
commit_version = session_clone.conf.get("spark.databricks.delta.lastCommitVersionInSession")
```

#### Observed results

Run it in databricks, see the userMetadata in history table, and get lastCommitVersionInSession from session_clone

Run it with open source delta 1.2.1, no userMetadata in history table, get null from session_clone, and get lastCommitVersionInSession from default spark session.

#### Expected results

userMetadata  and lastCommitVersionInSession should works within session_clone

#### Further details
