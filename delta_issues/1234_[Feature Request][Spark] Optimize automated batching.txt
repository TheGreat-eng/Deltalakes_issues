### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
Currently optimize is an all or nothing operation on all files in the table, or limited by a partition filter. The partition filter allows you to do manually batching of subsets of the table, but with clustering now a thing, there is no option to do partition filtering. We should add the ability to enable batch support inside of optimize, so chunks of optimized files can be added to the transaction log incrementally.

### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->
Currently you could rewrite an entire petabyte of data, just to fail on the last file and have all that be for naught, wasting a lot of compute time and storage space. With automatic batching, nearly all of the results would be saved along the way, and only the last batch that failed would have to be retried.

I think this can be fairly straightforward, just grouping the existing bins into another layer of batches.
