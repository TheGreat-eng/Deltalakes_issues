## Description

The `String` overloads of `DeltaLog.forTable` are dangerous, because we can't tell whether the caller intended to pass a path-string or a table-identifier string. Rework unit tests to no longer use the string+options overload of that method, preferring instead to use the `Path` that is almost always available.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing unit tests (PR mostly affects test code anyway)

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. `DeltaLog.forTable` is does not have private access (in spite of being an internal API), so technically it's possible some user was relying on the removed method. If this happens, they have an easy workaround -- just use the `Path` overload instead.
