## Feature request

### Overview

As a followup to the SHALLOW CLONE [support](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1505) for Delta Lake, it would be great if we could enable SHALLOW CLONE on an Iceberg table as well. This will be a CLONVERT (CLONE + CONVERT) operation, in which we will create a Delta catalog table with files pointing to the original Iceberg table in one transaction.

### Motivation

1. It allows users to quickly experiment with Delta Lake without modifying the original Iceberg table's data.
2. It simplifies the user flow by combining a Delta catalog table creation with an Iceberg conversion.

### Further details
Similar to SHALLOW CLONE, it will work as follows:

1. Clone a Iceberg catalog table (after the setup [here](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/getting-started/))

```
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] delta SHALLOW CLONE iceberg.db.table [TBLPROPERTIES clause] [LOCATION path]
```

2. Clone a path-based Iceberg table

```
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] delta SHALLOW CLONE iceberg.`/path/to/iceberg/table`[TBLPROPERTIES clause] [LOCATION path]
```
