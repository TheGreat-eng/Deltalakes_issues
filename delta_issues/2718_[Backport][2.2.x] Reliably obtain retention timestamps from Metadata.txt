Today, Delta log replay filters out expired `RemoveFile` tombstones and `SetTransaction` actions – but those retention periods are controlled by table properties and so log replay is required in order to properly access them.

Delta has no code to break that cycle, and so on cold start it will access an empty/defaulted metadata and thus ends up using default values for both retention periods – even if the user set the table property to something longer.

The solution is to craft a "miniature" version of log replay that only fetches protocol and metadata. The mini-replay can then run first, ensuring that the retention period table properties are reliably available during state reconstruction. This will add a small amount of latency to snapshot creation, but enforces correct behavior.
