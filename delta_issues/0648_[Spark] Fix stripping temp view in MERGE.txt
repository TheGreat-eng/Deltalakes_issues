## Description
We (unfortunately) allow running MERGE on views over Delta tables. We detect when the view is equivalent to a `SELECT * FROM target` and strip the plan to only keep the target logical relation.
That step doesn't handle more complex views, e.g. with multiple aliases and can then leave target plans with Project nodes that can cause analysis exceptions during MERGE execution.

This fix improves detecting and stripping views that are equivalent to `SELECT * FROM target`

## How was this patch tested?
- Expand existing MERGE into temp views tests and check that views are correctly removed from the target plan.
