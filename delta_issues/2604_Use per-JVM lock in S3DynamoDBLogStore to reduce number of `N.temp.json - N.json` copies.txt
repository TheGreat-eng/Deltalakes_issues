## Description
Adds a global (per JVM) path lock to S3DynamoDBLogStore to reduce the number of `T(N) -> N.json` copies, which can occur when there are concurrent readers/writers.

Note: multiple `T(N) -> N.json` copies will not cause data loss, but it may impact readers who already have an existing InputStream open on that particular file.

## How was this patch tested?

It's really hard to test this specific concurrency issue. Code review + existing tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
