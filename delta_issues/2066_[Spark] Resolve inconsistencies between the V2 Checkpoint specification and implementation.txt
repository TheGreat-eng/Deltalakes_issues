The V2 Checkpoint implementation does not match with what is expected in the PROTOCOL in some places.
It does not write some fields in the V2 Checkpoint-related actions:
1. flavor in checkpointMetadata
2. type in sidecar
Also,
3. The implementation writes a field called `version` (checkpoint version) in checkpointMetadata and relies on it but the PROTOCOL does not specify any such fields.
4. The PROTOCOL requires that the sidecarâ€™s relative file path should be specified under the field `fileName` in the sidecar action. But the implementation writes this under the field name `path`.

This PR updates the specification so that it correctly reflects the implementation.
