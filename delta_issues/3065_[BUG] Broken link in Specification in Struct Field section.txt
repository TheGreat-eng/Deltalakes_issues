## Bug

### Describe the problem
Link for `TODO` in the definition for [Struct Field](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#struct-field) is broken in specification.
There are few instances of `delta.` throughout the spec (Example: `delta.columnMapping.id`) but an exhaustive list is not available. Looks like this TODO in the struct field was intended to be updated later, but is missed.

#### Steps to reproduce
Not Applicable.

#### Observed results
Specification does not contain details about keys prefixed with Delta.

#### Expected results

Specification should provide an exhaustive list of reserved columns and how they should be handled.

#### Further details

Not applicable.

### Environment information

* Delta Lake version: Issue is with the spec.
* Spark version: Not Applicable
* Scala version: Not Applicable.
