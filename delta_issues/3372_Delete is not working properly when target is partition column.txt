
I am trying to delete partition using pyspark dataframe

```
df = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "s3a://421721-deltalake-test-bucket/data-l1/mart_1/")
df.delete("state = 'Australian Capital Territory'")
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "s3a://421721-deltalake-test-bucket/data-l1/mart_1/")
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
```

state is a partition column.

expected : the directory and manifest file of the deleted partition in _symlink_format_manifest are deleted, and when user tries to query that delete partition in Athena(select * from testtable where state='Australian Capital Territory''), no data returns.

actual result : if the deleting partition data includes space or dash('-'), manifest file is not deleted and user can query that data from Athena.  In above example, "Australian Capital Territory" has spaces, deleting partition does not work properly.
