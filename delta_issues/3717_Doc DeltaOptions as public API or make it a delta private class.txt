I was using Delta Lake and wanted set OVERWRITE_SCHEMA_OPTION to true, with

```scala
df.write.option(DeltaOptions. OVERWRITE_SCHEMA_OPTION, "true").format("delta")
```

however this application is broken in Databricks since the internal version is different with open source one and the support engineer said that DeltaOptions is private API

this actually confused users a lot, I saw a public class and straightforwardly referred to it only to find that we cannot use it in the platform of the company who created Delta Lake

I would suggest documenting DeltaOptions as a public API and committed to backward compatibility or make it a delta private class so others will not fall into the same issue
