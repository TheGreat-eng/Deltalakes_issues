Hi Guys

I created a delta dataset with year-month partition, each partition has 1.5gb - 2.5gb, so start my streaming job with merge. I enabled the option spark.delta.merge.repartitionBeforeWrite like documentation recommend.
Problably delta is running repartition(partition_column) and creates bigger files, like 2gb, 2.5gb.

Is there any way to tells delta repartition in more files? It could be a new feature?
