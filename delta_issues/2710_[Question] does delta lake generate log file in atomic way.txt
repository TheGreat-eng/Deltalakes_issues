We have a customized service monitor _delta_log folder, whenever a new 000000XX.json file appears, the service will parse it and find which parquet files are added factually.

In order to avoid any missing data  (e.g. service load a JSON log file while it is still writing, thus service ends up with a partial read), a straight forward question is do we generate JSON log file atomically?

Thanks
