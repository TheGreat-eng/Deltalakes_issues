I created an external Delta Lake table pointing to a location. Then rename the location folder. Then tried to alter the location. It gives me an error saying `Error in SQL statement: AnalysisException: ``<table>`` is not a Delta table.;`

I am attaching the MCVE notebook. Extract the `Delta-bug.zip` and you will get the Databricks Notebook.
