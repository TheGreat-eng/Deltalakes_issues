#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

### Describe the problem
Flink Version: 1.16.0
Dependencies in the client classpath:

I added following dep in server classpath:
Flink SQL> ADD JAR '/opt/flink-webssh/lib/delta-flink-3.0.0rc1.jar';
Flink SQL> ADD JAR '/opt/flink-webssh/lib/delta-standalone_2.12-3.0.0rc1.jar';
Flink SQL> ADD JAR '/opt/flink-webssh/lib/shapeless_2.12-2.3.4.jar';
Flink SQL> ADD JAR '/opt/flink-webssh/lib/parquet-hadoop-bundle-1.12.2.jar';
Flink SQL> ADD JAR '/opt/flink-webssh/lib/flink-parquet-1.16.0.jar';

a. Let's just say I inserted data in delta format to abfs to a table of schema:

while doing SELECT *, I get this.

and in ABFS directory, I get this.

So, basically from this , I gather that only the first char of string datatype is taken, which is a problem with flink-delta story.
Is it about flink version mismatch.? 

* Delta Lake version: 3.0.0rc1
