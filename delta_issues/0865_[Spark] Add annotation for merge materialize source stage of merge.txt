## Description

Originally MERGE source materialization was lazy, and triggered when the source was used for the first time. Because of that, it couldn't be cleanly separated as a stage. Since it was changed to be eager, we can now annotate it, which should make it easier to find in Spark UI.

## How was this patch tested?

Merge materialize source stage is now annotated:

Unit tests validate that the new stage is present in MERGE commit metrics.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
