## Description

Historically, path-based table resolution logic has been scattered all over Delta's code base. We can build on recent code improvements to start harmonizing and centralizing that logic in `DeltaTableV2`, which already plays a central role in all table resolution. Future changes can continue building on this base.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing unit tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
