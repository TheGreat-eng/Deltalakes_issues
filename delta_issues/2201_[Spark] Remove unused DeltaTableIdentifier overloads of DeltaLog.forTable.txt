## Description

The `DeltaTableIdentifier` overloads of `DeltaLog.forTable` involve an internal catalog lookup, which interferes with https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2052 because the resulting `CatalogTable` is lost. Fortunately, the overloads are not actually used, so we can simply delete them to prevent any future problems.

## How was this patch tested?

Dead code removal. Compilation suffices.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
