## Description

We want Delta to be able to cross-compile against Spark 3.5 and Spark Master (4.0).

Previously we have gotten Delta production code to compile (in a branch that enables shimming).

This PR gets the test code to compile, too, using changes that are forwards-compatible with spark master.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests.
