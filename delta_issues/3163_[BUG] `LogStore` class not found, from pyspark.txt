## Bug

### Describe the problem

I've upgraded python `delta-spark` to 1.2.0 (and `pyspark` to 3.3.0). When I run `pyspark`, I see the below error (in observed results).

I believe as part of #954, the `LogStore` class was [changed](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/c068f5abd6146f8d94e87b29cddb6af51a6b6d44#diff-f0c18983a6b0029c674bdd12a930103afc7ed09baebb1b9fbc238a5af55d87d0R153) to now use `io.delta.storage.S3SingleDriverLogStore`.

The problem appears to be that the `LogStore` class isn't present in the [python artefact](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases/tag/v1.2.0) leading to the below error. Is this an oversight in the packaging, or should I be specifying an extra dependency to bring in this class?

I also see errors about the `S3SingleDriverLogStore`, which I assume are consequences of this.

#### Steps to reproduce

Upgrade to `delta-spark` `1.2.0`, and run via python (with the default logger).

#### Observed results

```
py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o2176.execute.
5679E                   : com.google.common.util.concurrent.ExecutionError: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: io/delta/storage/LogStore
```

#### Expected results

A successful run, using the `LogStore` class to log to S3.

#### Further details

n/a
