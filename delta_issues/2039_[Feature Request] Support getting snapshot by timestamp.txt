## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
<!--
Please add the component selected below to the beginning of the issue title
For example: [Feature Request][Spark] Title of my issue
-->

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [x] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview
Currently, Kernel only supports reading the latest snapshot in a table (API [here](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/java/kernel/io/delta/kernel/Table.html)) This task is to add support for fetching a snapshot by timestamp. 

```
interface Table
{
  /**
   * Get the latest snapshot that is create at given time or the first snapshot
   * committed after the given timestamp. Given timestamp in in seconds sinc
   * epoch in UTC timezone.
   */
  Snapshot getSnapshotAtOrAfterTimestamp(long secondsSinceEpochUTC)
}
```

#### Design Questions
- Should we even support the getSnapshotAtOrAfterTimestamp?
   - If yes, what should be the input timestamp? Timezone? seconds , micorseconds, milliseconds?
- How should the FileStatus returned by FileSystemClient.listFrom contain the modification time? Which timezone? Does the filesystem expose the mod time in UTC?
