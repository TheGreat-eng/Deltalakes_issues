Could you please release the Python API via the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/)

It would help adoption and development flows to be able to install via `pip` instead of having to copy the source tree into projects.

Since the API seems compatible, this would be especially useful for developers testing and linting locally while running against the Databricks API.

Thank you.
