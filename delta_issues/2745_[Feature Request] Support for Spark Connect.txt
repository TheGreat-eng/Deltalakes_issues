## Feature request

### Overview

The Spark community is adding a new interface to Spark 3.4 that is called [Spark Connect](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mnl6jmGszixLW4KcJU5j9IgpG9-UabS0dcM6PM2XGDc/edit). This new interface promises several benefits by separating user code from Spark by adding a gRPC layer between the user code and the driver. We should add a new implementation of the `DeltaTable` interface that is compatible with Spark Connect.

### Motivation

Delta Connect is expected to bring the same benefits as Spark Connect:

1. Easier upgrading to more recent versions of Spark and Delta, as the client interface is completely decoupled from the server.
2. Simpler integration of Spark and Delta with developer tooling. IDEs no longer have to integrate with the full Spark and Delta implementation, and instead can integrate with a thin-client.
3. Support for languages other than Java/Scala and Python. Clients "merely" have to generate Protocol Buffers and therefore become simpler to implement.
4. Spark and Delta will become more stable, as user code is no longer running in the same JVM as Spark's driver.
5. Remote connectivity. Code can run anywhere now, as there is a gRPC layer between the user interface and the driver.

### Further details

We can add support for Delta to Spark Connect by implementing the extension points that it provides. We can use the `extension` field in the `Relation` and `Command` messages to add Delta specific relations such as `DescribeHistory` and commands such as `Vacuum` respectively. On the server-side we can implement the `RelationPlugin` and `CommandPlugin` to translate these Protobuf messages to `LogicalPlan` nodes in Spark.
