Currently, the vacuum command uses time internal to determine the version history to be retained in the delta table.  But this approach does not work when different rows in a table can version (get changes) at different times.  For e.g. some rows may update daily versus others may update monthly.  When the requirement is to keep x number of history versions for each row then time-internal based history retention is not ideal.  Instead, there should be the capability to retain history based on the number of past versions that get applied to all rows in a table irrespective of the time-interval.
