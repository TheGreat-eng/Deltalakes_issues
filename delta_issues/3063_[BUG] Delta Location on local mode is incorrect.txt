## Bug

### Describe the problem

When creating a delta table specifying the location on spark local the delta_log files appear on the proper path but the table is registered in the metastore with a prefix to the path!

#### Steps to reproduce

Here is a sample sbt project: https://github.com/adrianabreu/delta-1.1.0-table-location-error-example/blob/master/src/test/scala/example/HelloSpec.scala

```scala
    val spark = SparkSession
    .builder()
    .enableHiveSupport()
    .master("local")
    .appName("test-session")
    .getOrCreate()

    spark.sql("""CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS bronze""")
    spark.sql("""CREATE TABLE bronze.users (
    |  name string,
    |  active boolean
    |)
    |USING delta
    |LOCATION 'spark-warehouse/users'""".stripMargin)

```

#### Observed results

The table location in the metastore is registered as:

`spark-warehouse/bronze.db/spark-warehouse/users`

#### Expected results

The table location should be: `spark-warehouse/users`

#### Further details

When no db is specified it works as expected
