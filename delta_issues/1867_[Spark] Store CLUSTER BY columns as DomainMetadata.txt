Resolves https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2447

According to the [protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#writer-requirements-for-clustered-table), store the CLUSTER BY columns as DomainMetadata. This completes the table creation path for clustered tables.

Summary:
* Introduce a new DomainMetadata called `ClusteringMetadataDomain` that tracks clustering columns
* Extract the clustering columns passed down from the transform array and perform validations:
  * clustering column should have stats collected
  * number of clustering columns should not be greater than 4 (controlled by a config)
  * appending to a clustered table should have matching clustering columns
  * disallow replacing a clustered table with partitioned table
  * disallow dropping clustering columns
* Introduce a `ClusteringColumn` to hold physical names in order to support Column Mapping

Since clustered table support is still in preview, introduce a config to by default throw an exception when creating or writing to a clustered table.
