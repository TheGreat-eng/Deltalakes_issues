Hi, 
I Created a delta table and got the below WARN. Seems like because of delta format table 
is not getting stored in Hive metasore.
I want to access delta table using tableau spark sql driver which uses sparkThriftServer, just wanted check if there is anyway ? 
scala> spark.sql("create table FL_insurance using delta location 'file:/Users/cklekkala/Documents/SparkWorkSpace/FL_insurance'")
19/10/13 03:07:08 WARN HiveExternalCatalog: Couldn't find corresponding Hive SerDe for data source provider delta. Persisting data source table `default`.`fl_insurance` into Hive metastore in Spark SQL specific format, which is NOT compatible with Hive.
