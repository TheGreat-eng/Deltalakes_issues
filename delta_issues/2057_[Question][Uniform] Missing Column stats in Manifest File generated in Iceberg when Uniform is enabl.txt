While trying out Uniform found the Manifest file created in Iceberg, doesn't contain Column stats like `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, `null_counts`.
This would have impact on the query latency as column stats are used for pruning. Is Converting the stats from Delta files, and adding it to Iceberg Manifest file in works?
