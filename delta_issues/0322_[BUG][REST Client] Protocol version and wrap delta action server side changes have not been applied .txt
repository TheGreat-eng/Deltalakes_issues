## Bug

#### Delta rest client

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [x] Other (REST Client)

### DeltaSharingProfile and Protocol version has not been updated to version 3 which impacts to rest client when connecting to a server that has tables with corresponding versions.
Server side change (Wrap delta action in the response action when responseFormat=delta) addressed in [PR](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/commit/2eca6689be0dafe34f69a544da67b8c30e857b40) has not been updated in rest client side

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Connect to a deltashare server with Protocol version 3 tables (Ideally tables with deletion vectors)
2. Call query_table_metadata function on the DataSharingRestClient

```
client = DataSharingRestClient(DeltaSharingProfile.from_json(json.dumps(profile)))
client.set_delta_format_header()
table_metadata = client.query_table_metadata(Table.from_json(table_json))

print(table_metadata.metadata.schema_string)
```

#### Observed results

`An error occurred: 'minReaderVersion'`

#### Expected results

table_metadata variable should populated without any error
