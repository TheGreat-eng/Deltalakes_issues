In this PR, I am adding the TPCDS benchmark in the newly added benchmark framework. It is constructed such that you have to run the follow two steps. 
1. *Load data*: You have to create the TPC-DS database with all the Delta tables. To do that, the raw TPC-DS data has been provided as Apache Parquet files. In this step you will have to use your EMR cluster to read the parquet files and rewrite them as Delta tables.
2. *Query data*: Then, using the tables definitions in the Hive Metatore, you can run the 99 benchmark queries.   

Please see the README updates for more details.

*Note for reviewers*: This PR looks massive because of all the TPCDS SQL queries. If they are ignored, then it's not really a lot of code.
