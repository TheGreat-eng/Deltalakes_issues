## Description
The `DeltaParquetFileFormat` adds additional glue for filtering the deleting rows (according to the deletion vector) from the iterator returned by the `ParquetFileFormat`. In case when the DV file is not found, the iterator returned from `ParquetFileFormat` should be close.

## How was this patch tested?
An integration simulating the DV file deletion and verifying no resource leak.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No
