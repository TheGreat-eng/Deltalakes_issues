We update the arguments of addColumn method: 
- Support a new data type for parameter `generatedAlwaysAs`. Users can specify `generatedAlwaysAs` as `IdentityGenerator` to add an identity column that is GENERATED ALWAYS. 

- Add a new parameter `generatedByDefaultAs`. Users can specify `generatedByDefaultAs` as `IdentityGenerator` to add an identity column that is GENERATED BY DEFAULT. 

- Users can optionally pass in `start` (default = 1) and `step` (default = 1) values to construct `IdentityGenerator` object, which specify the start and step value to generate the identity column.


Interface
```
 def addColumn(
        self,
        colName: str,
        dataType: Union[str, DataType],
        nullable: bool = True,
        generatedAlwaysAs: Optional[Union[str, IdentityGenerator]] = None,
        generatedByDefaultAs: Optional[IdentityGenerator] = None,
        comment: Optional[str] = None,
) -> "DeltaTableBuilder"
```
Example Usage

```
 DeltaTable.create()
    .tableName("tableName")
    .addColumn("id", dataType=LongType(), generatedAlwaysAs=IdentityGenerator())
    .execute()

 DeltaTable.create()
    .tableName("tableName")
    .addColumn("id", dataType=LongType(), generatedAlwaysAs=IdentityGenerator(start=1, step=1))
    .execute()

 DeltaTable.create()
    .tableName("tableName")
    .addColumn("id", dataType=LongType(), generatedByDefaultAs=IdentityGenerator())
    .execute()
