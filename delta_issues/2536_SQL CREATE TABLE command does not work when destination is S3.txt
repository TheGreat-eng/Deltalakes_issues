## Bug
SQL CREATE TABLE command fails when destination is S3

### Describe the problem
When simply defining a table without populating it, spark throws an error when attempting to write to an s3 bucket.  The same command works fine when writing to the local filesystem.  Also, I am able to write to s3 without trouble when doing a `CREATE TABLE AS...` command.  I am not sure if this is the intended behavior or a bug.  I searched both open and closed issues and wasn't able to find one that matched the error I encountered, so I am creating a bug report.

#### Steps to reproduce

A command such as this one:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE delta.`s3a://<bucket_name>/people10m' (
      id INT,
      firstName STRING,
      middleName STRING,
      lastName STRING,
      gender STRING,
      birthDate TIMESTAMP,
      ssn STRING,
      salary INT
    ) USING DELTA;
```
fails, whereas the following command does work:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE default.people10m (
      id INT,
      firstName STRING,
      middleName STRING,
      lastName STRING,
      gender STRING,
      birthDate TIMESTAMP,
      ssn STRING,
      salary INT
    ) USING DELTA;
```

As does this one:

```CREATE TABLE delta.`s3a://<bucket_name>/delta-table` USING DELTA AS SELECT col1 as id FROM VALUES 0,1,2,3,4;"```

#### Observed results

```ParseException: 
Syntax error at or near '`': extra input '`'(line 2, pos 36)

== SQL ==

    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE delta.`s3a://<bucket_name>/people10m' (...
```

#### Expected results

No Error

### Environment information

* Delta Lake version: 2.3
* Spark version: 3.3.2
* Scala version: using PySpark (Python 3.10.11)
