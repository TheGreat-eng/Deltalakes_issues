Delta Lake 1.2.1

[AlterTableReplaceColumnsDeltaCommand](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/alterDeltaTableCommands.scala#L517) does not seem to be used as `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` (that seems to be the command to trigger it) is currently taken care of by [AlterTableChangeColumnDeltaCommand](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/alterDeltaTableCommands.scala#L331).
