## Feature request

### Overview

Delta tables with generated columns sometimes produce confusing error messages.  We should be able to make the error messaging more intuitive.

### Motivation

Users will understand error messages for Delta tables better if the messaging is more precise.

### Further details

Suppose you have the following Delta table:

```python
(
    DeltaTable.create(spark)
    .tableName("default.some_people")
    .addColumn("id", "LONG")
    .addColumn("first_name", "STRING")
    .addColumn("last_name", "STRING")
    .addColumn("age", "LONG")
    .addColumn(
        "full_name", "STRING", generatedAlwaysAs="concat(first_name, ' ', last_name)"
    )
    .execute()
)
```

And you try to append the following DataFrame:

```python
df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [
        (8, "Liam", 66),
        (9, "Colin", 77),
    ]
).toDF("id", "first_name", "age")

df.write.option("mergeSchema", "true").mode("append").format("delta").saveAsTable(
    "some_people"
)
```

Here's the error message you'll get:

```
AnalysisException: Column 'last_name' does not exist. Did you mean one of the following? [first_name, age, id]; line 1 pos 24;
'Project [id#2335L AS id#2391L, first_name#2336 AS first_name#2392, age#2337L AS age#2393L, 'concat(first_name#2336,  , 'last_name) AS full_name#2394]
+- Project [_1#2329L AS id#2335L, _2#2330 AS first_name#2336, _3#2331L AS age#2337L]
   +- LogicalRDD [_1#2329L, _2#2330, _3#2331L], false
```

Perhaps this would be a better error message:

`full_name` is a generated column that is populated with this expression `concat(first_name, ' ', last_name)`.  You're trying to append a DataFrame with the following columns: [first_name, age, id].  This DataFrame does not contain the `last_name` column that's required by the generated column expression, so this transaction cannot be performed.
