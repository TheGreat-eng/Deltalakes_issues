## Description

- Updates the `goldenTables` project to include utils that exposes the resource file path. Updates other projects to depend on it and use that for getting the golden table file paths.
  - Moves the resources to `src/main/resources` so that other projects can depend on the `goldenTables` compile conf and skip all the test dependencies
- Updates `goldenTables` to use the latest `delta-spark` version (just fixes a couple compile errors)
- Update the kernelDefault `DeletionVectorSuite`
   - Update `"end-to-end usage: reading partitioned dv table with checkpoint"` to use a golden table since that's how the resource table was originally generated. Adds this table to GoldenTables and removes the no longer used test resource table.
   - Update the test resource `"dv-with-columnmapping"` to actually have DV enabled (previously it mistakenly wasn't).
