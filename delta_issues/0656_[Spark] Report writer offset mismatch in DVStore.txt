## Description

We identified a potential issue with the API used to write DV to files, where the `DataOutputStream.size()` method may not return the correct file size. Our investigation revealed that `DataOutputStream` maintains its own byte count, but its `write(data)` method does not increment this counter `DataOutputStream` has multiple subclasses, which might override the counter or the `write(data)` method to update the counter correctly. We want to find out which class is being used when the issue occurs, thus this PR.

To address this, we introduced our own mechanism to track the number of bytes written, which will be used solely for logging. If there is a discrepancy between the system's reported file size and our own record, a Delta event will be triggered.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
