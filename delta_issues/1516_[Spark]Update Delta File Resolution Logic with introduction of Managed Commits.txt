## Description

This PR introduces necessary adjustments in our approach to locating delta files, prompted by the adoption of managed-commits. Previously, certain code paths assumed the existence of delta files for a specific version at a predictable path `_delta_log/$x.json`. This assumption is no longer valid with managed-commits, where delta files may alternatively be located at `_delta_log/_commits/$x.$uuid.json`. We attempt to locate the correct delta files from the Snapshot's LogSegment now.

## How was this patch tested?

Add managed-commits to some of the existing UTs

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
