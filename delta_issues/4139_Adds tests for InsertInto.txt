This PR adds a bunch of tests for insert into through the DataFrameWriter + SQL APIs. Most of these tests were inlined over from OSS Spark and we add more tests around schema enforcement in INSERT INTO which is a new feature.

We also add support for the syntax delta.`/some/path` and use this in INSERT INTO so that users can do 
```sql
INSERT INTO delta.`/some/path` VALUES (1, "a")
```
