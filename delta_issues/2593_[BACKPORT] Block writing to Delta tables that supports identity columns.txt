## Description

This PR fixes an issue described in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1694, where it is possible to INSERT values into an identity column without updating the high watermark.

This issue is caused by a misplaced check in `actions.scala`. The check didn't fire for INSERTs.

## How was this patch tested?

Added new tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. After this PR is merged, it will no longer be possible to write to a table that has `minWriterVersion` = `6`, or has `identityColumns` in `writerFeatures`.

Closes delta-io/delta#1695
