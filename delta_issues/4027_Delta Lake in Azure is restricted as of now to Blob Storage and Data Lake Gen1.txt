On the official Data Lake **Gen2** documentation, it is stated that the Hadoop support is only for versions 3.2+. 

On Delta IO the documentation only refers Azure Data Lake Storage **Gen1**, whose requirements are:  Spark 2.4.2 and above built with Hadoop version 2.9.1 and above **(not 3.x)**

As far as i can tell, Databricks Runtime 5.5 supports Delta Lake Gen2, but Delta Lake open source does not.

At this time, Delta Lake open-source only supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Blob Storage? Is this correct?

Can we expect Azure Data Lake Gen2 support anytime soon?

Thank you!
