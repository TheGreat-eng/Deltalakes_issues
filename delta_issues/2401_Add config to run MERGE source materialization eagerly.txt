(Cherry-pick of 4932956ae52f7a1211999f5364b6f9e1875d183a to branch-2.3)

Add config to run MERGE source materialization eagerly.
Add a new config that that controls whether the MERGE source is materialized eagerly or lazily.
New config is set to eager by default to avoid suspected determinism issues with lazy materialization.

## How was this patch tested?

Run most sensitive tests with both eager and lazy settings, the rest only with the default to not blow up the CI time unnecessarily.
