This is a work in progress PR that upgrades SBT to 1.3.10. This brings a number of enhancements:
- Coursier based dependency resolution - Coursier resolves much faster than Ivy. This is true both in CI (when first downloading dependencies) and during local/iterative development (re-resolution on startup and between commands is faster as well)
- Better Console - The SBT console now shows inprogress compile/test/tasks (similar to Bazel)
- Parallel Test Execution - This was also available in SBT 0.13.x, but it's now easier to configure and enable across all test projects while still being able to control parallelism

This PR is still WIP as a number of workflows need to be tested and changes need to be verified
- Releasing a new version of Delta - I had to bump the sbt-release plugin.
- Ensuring Coursier and Ivy produce the same dependency resolution - it's possible that Delta pulls in artifacts with different versions as a result of the switch to Coursier. If this is the case, we may need to manually pin artifacts & versions.
- A few test cases fail when run in parallel - we'll need to either fix them tag them to run serially.

The biggest TODO is re-building sbt-spark-package for SBT 1.x - This is the one SBT plugin that doesn't have an SBT 1.x compatible version.
