### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
UniForm now supports both Hudi and Iceberg. But the comment in `UniversalFormat.scala` is outdated, only mentioning support to Iceberg. These comment in `UniversalFormat.scala` should be updated to describe the UniForm support to Hudi.

Example comments from the file:
```
Currently, UniForm only supports Iceberg. When `delta.universalFormat.enabledFormats` contains"iceberg", we say that Universal Format (Iceberg) is enabled.
