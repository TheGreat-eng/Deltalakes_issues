This pull request is an attempt to resolve issue #919.

This PR adds instructions in the example directory for a dockerfile.

Instructions on what the image is trying to do:
The base is derived from `jupyter/minimal-notebook` and it installs openjdk-8 and r-lang.

It also installs deltalake 1.1.0, and uses jupytext to convert all the sample python notebooks into example ipynb files.

spark-defaults.conf is also set to introduce delta jars and delta configurations.

The intent is after running the container you have a playground to start using delta, with some starter notebooks.

Go to examples:
```
cd examples
```
To build:
```bash
docker build -t delta-lake-playground:latest .
```
To run:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 delta-lake-playground
```

Notes: This image uses python 3.9.x. Those are the only images provided by jupyter that are supporting both intel + arm based builds.

Access the jupyterlab instance via `http://localhost:8888/lab?token=docker`
