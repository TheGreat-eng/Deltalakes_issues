## Feature request

### Overview

[mack](https://github.com/MrPowers/mack/issues/110) is considering adding `DeltaTable.alter` to their Python API but I think it belongs here.

### Motivation

If [mack](https://github.com/MrPowers/mack/issues/110) considers it worth discussing perhaps there are other teams as well.

The change would also complement the API to match SQL.

### Willingness to contribute

- Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the Delta Lake community.
