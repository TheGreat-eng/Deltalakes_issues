## Description

During log reconstruction we throw a bunch of various errors when we encounter a table state that we consider invalid. This PR updates some of those errors to be `InvalidTableException`. This doesn't necessarily cover all possible exceptions due to an invalid table, just some of the known and clear cases during log reconstruction.

## How was this patch tested?

Updates existing tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, instead of internal `RuntimeExceptions` or `IllegalStateExceptions`, etc a `InvalidTableException` will be thrown when certain invalid table states are encountered.
