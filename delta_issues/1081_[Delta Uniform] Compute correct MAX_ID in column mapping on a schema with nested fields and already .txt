## Description
Propose a fix to prevent delta table got duplicate ids assigned when schema have nested fields and ids assigned.

**Issue**: today when we are assigning column's ids we first compute the `maxId` of existing columns and assign ids for new fields from `maxId + 1`. However, the existing code doesn't consider nested ids when computing the `maxId`, so it's possible to have duplicate ids assigned to different columns - which causes failure of uniform iceberg conversion since iceberg requires that id is unique for each column.

**Proposed fix**: we are adding the logic to consider nested fields' ids when computing `maxId`.
