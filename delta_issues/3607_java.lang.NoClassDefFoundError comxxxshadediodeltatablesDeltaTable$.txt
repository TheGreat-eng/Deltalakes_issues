I have a library in Databricks cluster, and this library has an API looks like below

>   def checkRange(deltaPath : String, endTime: String): Unit ={
    val d = io.delta.tables.DeltaTable.forPath(deltaPath)
}

when I call this API from notebook, I always get below error, does anyone have insight how to fix it? Thanks

**java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/xxx/shaded/io/delta/tables/DeltaTable$,**

I execute it on Azure Databricks, and runtime version is 7.3 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12)
