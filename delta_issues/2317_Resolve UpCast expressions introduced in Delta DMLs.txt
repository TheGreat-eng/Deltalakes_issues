## Description

https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1938 changed the casting behavior in MERGE and UPDATE to follow the value of the `storeAssignmentPolicy` config instead of the `ansiEnabled` one, making the behavior consistent with INSERT.

This change breaks MERGE and UPDATE operations that contain a cast when `storeAssignmentPolicy` is set to `STRICT`, throwing an internal error during analysis.

The cause is the `UpCast` expression added by `PreprocessTableMerge` and `PreprocessTableUpdate`  when processing assignments. `UpCast` is meant to be replaced by a regular cast after performing checks by the `ResolveUpCast` rule that runs during the resolution phase **before** `PreprocessTableMerge` and `PreprocessTableUpdate` introduce the expression, leaving the cast unresolved.

The fix is to run the `ResolveUpCast` rule once more after `PreprocessTableMerge` and `PreprocessTableUpdate`  have run.

## How was this patch tested?
Missing tests covering cast behavior for the different values of`storeAssignmentPolicy` for UPDATE and MERGE are added, covering:
- Invalid implicit cast (string -> boolean), valid implicit cast (string -> int), upcast (int -> long)
- UPDATE, MERGE
- storeAssignmentPolicy = LEGACY, ANSI, STRICT
