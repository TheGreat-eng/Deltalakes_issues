## Bug

The [Add File and Remove File](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#add-file-and-remove-file) doesn't explicitly says if the fields are required or optional. Could we add a column in the table saying if a field is required or optional?

For example, size and modificationTime are required?
