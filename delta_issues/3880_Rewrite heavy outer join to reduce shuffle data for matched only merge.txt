In matched only merge, current implementation is using a right outer join instead of full outer join. We can further rewrite the right out join to minimize the data in shuffle:
In right outer join, even there are some predicates in right side, it still needs all rows in`filesToRewrite` to preform join. We move right side only predicates from join conditions to its filters, then union the join and the right side which applied anti-predicates filters.

By our testing and practice, after applying this patch, the SMJ could be 5~10 times faster, which depends on how much data is skipping from shuffle.

79 billion rows have to participate in SMJ.
