## Description
Currently, the default Parquet writer returnes `numRows` statistics only if one or more column statistics are requested. This changes to always return the `numRows` in `DataFileStatus`. It is easy to compute the number of rows written without reading the Parquet footer. Reading parquet footer is needed for finding the column stats for written file.

The `numRows` stat is needed for supporting writing into Uniform enabled tables.
