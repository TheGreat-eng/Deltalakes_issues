## Description
- Updated build.sbt to add new subprojects for connectors.
  - Updated the unidoc settings to make sure it ignores all the new kernel and connectors code.
  - Moved unidoc generation testing into an explicit separate step (explicitly call `sbt test unidoc` from run-tests.py) instead of implicitly via sbt task dependencies.
   - Disabled code coverage because it was having problems with scala-2.13 builds and we were not really using it anyways.
- Added a new Github action for running all connector tests by copying the existing action from the connectors dir. 
- Renamed Spark test Github action file from tests.yaml to spark_tests.yaml
- Increased SBT's Java heap size with .sbtoptions
