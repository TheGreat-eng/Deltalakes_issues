## Description

The current example inlined Deletion Vector in PROTOCOL.md does not work. When trying to read a table with this deletion vector in spark, this is the error:

24/02/12 09:34:59 WARN TaskSetManager: Lost task 2.0 in stage 11.0 (TID 159) (10.0.0.160 executor driver): TaskKilled (Stage cancelled: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 11.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 11.0 (TID 157) (10.0.0.160 executor driver): java.io.IOException: Unexpected RoaringBitmapArray magic number -791463580

This PR replaces it with an inlined deletion vector that does work.
