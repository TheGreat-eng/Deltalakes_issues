## Description
Some of the sbt subprojects are built using the source version of the java version used to compile the project.
This creates class files with versions greater than 52.0, which will fail to run on JVM 1.8, which is typically used to run Spark.
We fix this by setting the scalac and javac source version explicitly in each subproject.
