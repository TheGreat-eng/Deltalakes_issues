## Description

This is the first PR in [[Feature Request] Support UPDATE command with Deletion Vectors](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1923).

This PR introduces a `UPDATE_USE_PERSISTENT_DELETION_VECTORS` config to enable/disable writing DVs for the UPDATE command. In short, rows being updated will be marked as `deleted` by DV, while updated rows will be written to a new file. When CDF is enabled, updated rows and CDC (`preimage` and `postimage`) will be written to the file.

## How was this patch tested?

New, preliminary tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. When `UPDATE_USE_PERSISTENT_DELETION_VECTORS` is set to true, `UPDATE` command will not rewrite the whole file but write only the rows being updated.
