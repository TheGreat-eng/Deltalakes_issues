## Bug
Currently the [doc](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/io/delta/tables/DeltaTable.scala#L621) for `DeltaTable.forPath` says `Create a DeltaTable for the data at the given `path`.`. This is not correct. This API just instantiates the `DeltaTable` representing the path. 

Also we need to clarify what it means when there is no table exists at the given path.
