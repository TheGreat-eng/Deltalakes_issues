## Feature request

- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink

### Overview

Right now the merge method on a DeltaTable allows one update or one delete per match clause. I propose to add a way to perform an update and an insert when a match is found to simplify the logic for SCD2.

### Motivation

As the [SCD2 example](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-update.html#slowly-changing-data-scd-type-2-operation-into-delta-tables) in the docs shows this currently requires a separate join to identify the rows that already exist in the source table and duplicate them into an "update-row" and an "insert-row".

### Further details

I've looked at the source of deltaMerge.scala, and it looks like this is a more complex task that just adding two clauses with the same condition to the DeltaMergeBuilder and expecting it to work, but I haven't delved deep into the code yet.
