## Feature request

### Overview

We saw a few reported issues due to missing configs. We can add a check in DeltaLog to verify the following Spark confs.

```
--conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"
```

If these are not set, we can throw a user friendly error.

### Motivation

Provide a user friendly error rather than throwing random weird errors.
