### Overview

Hi team, I'm wondering what's the reason we do the prepare delta scan sequentially [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/0a0366400f8b2eab71065401d48edbecf6ba890e/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/stats/PrepareDeltaScan.scala#L135-L152)? If the query plan has multiple DeltaTableScan Operator, then we should parallelize this to improve the performance?

### Motivation

When in a query plan, lots of Delta tables are scanned (in our case, it's 720 tables), parallelize deltaScans can speed up substantially and fully utilize the cluster resources.
