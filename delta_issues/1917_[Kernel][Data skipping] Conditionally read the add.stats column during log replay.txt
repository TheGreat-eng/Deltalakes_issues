## Description

Part of #2229 

Conditionally reads the "add.stats" column during log replay based on whether there is any data predicate in the scan filter. A follow-up PR will update this condition to be more specific and check whether a valid data skipping filter can be generated.

## How was this patch tested?

Adds a unit test that checks that the "add.stats" column is not read when there is no data predicate, and that it is correctly read when there is a data predicate. Once we add support for reading real statistics (and using them) this test will be refactored.
