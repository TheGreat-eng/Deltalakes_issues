## Description
currently we utilize the helper function
`shouldRewriteToBeIcebergCompatible` to filter the portion of parquet files that need to be rewritten when running `REORG UPGRADE UNIFORM` based on the tags in the `AddFile`.

however, the `DeltaUpgradeUniformOperation.icebergCompatVersion` is accidentally shadowed, which will make
`shouldRewriteToBeIcebergCompatible` always return `false` if the `AddFile.tags` is not `null` - this is not the expected semantic of this function.

this PR introduces the fix for this problem and add unit tests to ensure the correctness.

## How was this patch tested?
through unit tests in `UniFormE2ESuite.scala`.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes? 
no.
