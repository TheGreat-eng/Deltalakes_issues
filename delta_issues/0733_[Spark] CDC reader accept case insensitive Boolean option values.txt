## Description

`DeltaOptions` are equipped to accept case-insensitive values of boolean flags, but CDCReader was not, resulting in not-accepting 'True'. Make it case insensitive. 

A separate bug in Spark Connect was causing "True" to be passed from Python boolean True. That is being fixed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47790

## How was this patch tested?

Tests added.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Datasource option to enable CDC should now accept "True" and other mixed-case variants and not only "true".
