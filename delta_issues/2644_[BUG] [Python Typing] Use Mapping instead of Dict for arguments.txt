## Bug


### Describe the problem

Using `Dict[str, Union[str, Column]]` in the method arguments makes it very hard to pass anything to the method without failing the type checker. Not only are custom mapping types unsupported (which is a rare use case, but still), but more importantly, the values *must* conform to the `Union[str, Column]` type, which means you cannot use `str`, you cannot use `Column`, it must be a Union of both. 

This is not a useful type hint.

Using a generic `collections.abc.Mapping` fixes this issue. `Mapping` has the added benefit of being an immutable type, which is good to show in the public interface if possible.

*Note*: If you support Python versions below 3.9, use `typing.Mapping` instead, as the collections Mapping is not generic before 3.9.


#### Steps to reproduce

Using mypy to check the following code yields an error:

```python
from delta import DeltaTable
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark: SparkSession = ...

updates = spark.read.table("updates")
update_column_dict = {"updates.a": "a"}
DeltaTable.forName(spark, "target").merge(
    updates, condition="target.id = updates.id"
).whenMatchedUpdate(
    set=update_column_dict
).execute()
```

Running `mypy test.py`

```
error: Argument "values" to "whenMatchedUpdate" of "DeltaMergeBuilder" has incompatible type "Dict[str, str]"; expected "Dict[str, Union[str, Column]]"  [arg-type]
note: "Dict" is invariant -- see https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#variance
note: Consider using "Mapping" instead, which is covariant in the value type
```


#### Further details

This should be changed to `Mapping[str, ExpressionOrColumn]`

and then here, check for any mapping instead of a dict:

I might be missing something though.
