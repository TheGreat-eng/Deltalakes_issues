## Bug

### Describe the problem
I have this setup: A AWS Glue Job `kinesis_consumer` that consumes a kinesis stream and stores the data in s3 bucket `kinesis_data`. 

```
kinesis = (
            spark.readStream.format("kinesis")
            .option("streamName", stream_name)
            .option("endpointUrl", x)
            .option("region", region)
            .option("startingPosition", position)
            .option("minOffsetPerTrigger", tim)
            .load()


stream_data.writeStream \
                .format("delta") \
                .outputMode("append") \
                .trigger(processingTime="200 seconds") \
                .option("checkpointLocation", checkpoint_location) \
                .start(s3_target)
        spark.streams.awaitAnyTermination()
```
Another Glue Job `data_exposer` is supposed to read the data from the s3 bucket `kinesis_data` and store it in a different s3 bucket `exposed_data`:
```
df = spark.readStream \
                    .format("delta") \
                    .option("ignoreDeletes", "true") \
                    .option("startingVersion", "latest") \
                    .load(s3_target)
df.writeStream \
        .format("delta") \
        .outputMode("append") \
        .option("ignoreChanges","true") \
        .option("checkpointLocation", s3_chckp) \
        .start(s3_path)
```
When I try to read from the `kinesis_data` with Glue Job `data_exposer` I am getting this error:
```
java.io.FileNotFoundException: No such file or directory 's3://kinesis-data/kinesis/_delta_log/00000000000000000016.json'
It is possible the underlying files have been updated. You can explicitly invalidate the cache in Spark by running 'REFRESH TABLE tableName' command in SQL or by recreating the Dataset/DataFrame involved
```
I am assume I must have misunderstood something. Could you please tell me what am I doing wrong?
