## Description

This PR adds a check to `txn.commitLarge` to avoid cloning DVs to a table while disabling DV table prop:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl SHALLOW CLONE tbl_dv TBLPROPERTIES('delta.enableDeletionVectors'='false')
```

Before: `tbl_dv` will have DVs.
After: the transaction will fail.
