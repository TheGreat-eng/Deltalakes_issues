## Feature request

### Overview

Currently the semantics for `REPLACE TABLE` is unclear, right now it acts like a combination of "emptying existing data" + "create new table". This makes it confusing with `INSERT OVERWRITE` and `.mode('overwrite').option('overwriteSchema', 'true')`. We should flesh out their semantics matrix clearly.

### Motivation

To provide better user semantics.
