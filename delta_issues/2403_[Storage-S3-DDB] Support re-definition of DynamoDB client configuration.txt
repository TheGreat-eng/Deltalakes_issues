The current implementation of `S3DynamoDBLogStore` class defines the DynamoDB client configuration as a private `getClient()` method, which cannot be overridden.
In our case we needed to re-define the endpoint for the DynamoDB client, which forces us to copy the full `S3DynamoDBLogStore.java` file just to override the DynamoDB client configuration.

In addition, the current code in the `getClient()` method uses the deprecated direct construction of DynamoDB client, which was replaced with the builder-style construction in this patch.

## How was this patch tested?

<!--
If tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to test the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.

-->

We used and tested the customized code in our environment.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

The existing clients will unlikely see any changes at all. Those who need to re-define the DynamoDB client setup will be able to do so.
