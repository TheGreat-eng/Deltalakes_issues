## Feature request

### Overview

Currently when column mapping tables are overwritten with `.mode("overwrite")` and `.option("overwriteSchema", "true")`, it recomputes physical names for new data files. This would break previously analyzed dataframes and streaming queries because of schema being unreadable, even when the logical schema are the same.

We can improve this by reusing datatype compatible columns' physical names.

### Motivation

As described.
