This pull request enhances `configure_spark_with_delta_pip` function to add an optional parameter extra_packages to allow for users to add their custom jars as required.

A test was added class was added `PipUtilsCustomJarsTests` to unit test by adding a duplicate of the delta jar and see if spark conf contained both jars in the assertion.

A new test class was added due to having to modify the spark session rather than using the existing test class. 

This resolves issue #889.
