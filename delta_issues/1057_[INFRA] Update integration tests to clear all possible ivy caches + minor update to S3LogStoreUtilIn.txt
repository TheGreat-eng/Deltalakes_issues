## Description

During integration testing and QA for the 4.0 preview release we noticed clearing the `~/.ivy2/` caches was not sufficient. This PR updates any scripts that clear artifacts to check for any subfolders that start with ".ivy" and clear any artifacts from there.

Also removes the conf setting `ProfileCredentialsProvider` as the credential provider for `S3LogStoreUtilIntegrationTest`. The default credential chain provider should include `ProfileCredentialsProvider` anyways, and removing it allows us to provide credentials in any of the other ways supported in the chain provider.

## How was this patch tested?

Ran the `S3LogStoreUtilIntegrationTest` as well as ran `run-integration-tests.py` locally to check it clears the right caches.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
