### Overview
This feature request tracks the remaining effort to fully implement [Row Tracking](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1747).
The feature required changes in Spark that are being released with Spark 3.5. With Spark 3.5 being released, fully implementing the feature is now unblocked. 

### Further details

Row tracking specification was added with https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/8dfa534b11c300319b00d1ab62b6be9150a16177 and https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1747. See [Row ID design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ji3zIWURSz_qugpRHjIV_2BUZPVKxYMiEFaDORt_ULA/edit?usp=sharing)  for the initial design.

Support for writing fresh row IDs / row commit versions was introduced in the following PRs and didn't require any changes in Spark:
- https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1723
- https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1781
- https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1896

Reading and preserving row IDs / row commit versions on the other does require changes that are shipping with Spark 3.5 (see e.g. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40677 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40545). With Spark 3.5 we can now implement reading and preserving row tracking information
