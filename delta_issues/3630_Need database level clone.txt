Currently, delta lake supports various types of cloning on tables. There are many use-cases where we need to replicate the environment on a database level as of now I've been using a separate notebook that creates a specified database, generates tables from the specified database, and clones based on shallow or deep argument ( here shallow or deep applied to all tables although I use deep all time ). It would be great if there is a utility that supports database cloning.
