The main goal of this Pull Request is to create a ```delta``` function which replaces the ```.format("delta")``` we use whenever we want to read/write from/in a delta table .
I used the Scala "Pimp My Library" Pattern in order to extend the following APIs : 

- DataFrameReader
- DataStreamReader
- DataFrameWriter
- DataStreamWriter

I tested this feature by replacing, in the ```DeltaSourceSuite.scala```, all the ```.format("delta")``` by the function ```.delta(path)```
