Most of changes are caused by the following two breaking changes in Scala.

- scala.Seq[+A] is now an alias for scala.collection.immutable.Seq[A] (instead of scala.collection.Seq[A]). Note that this also changes the type of Scala varargs methods.
- mapValues and filterKeys now return a MapView instead of a Map.

The fix is just adding `toSeq` and `toMap`.
