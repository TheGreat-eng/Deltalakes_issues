## Description
Expose the type widening table feature outside of testing and set its preview user-facing name: typeWidening-preview (instead of typeWidening-dev used until now).

Feature description: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2622
The type changes that are supported for not are `byte` -> `short` -> `int`. Other types depend on Spark changes which are going to land in Spark 4.0 and will be available once Delta picks up that Spark version.

## How was this patch tested?
Extensive testing in `DeltaTypeWidening*Suite`.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
User facing changes were already covered in PRs implementing this feature. In short, it allows:
- Adding the type widening table feature (using a table property)
```
ALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES (â€˜delta.enableTypeWidening = true);
```
- Manual type changes:
```
ALTER TABLE t CHANGE COLUMN col TYPE INT;
```
- Automatic type changes via schema evolution:
```
CREATE TABLE target (id int, value short);
CREATE TABLE source (id int, value in);
SET spark.databricks.delta.schema.autoMerge.enabled = true;
INSERT INTO target SELECT * FROM source;
-- value now has type int in target
```
- Dropping the table feature which rewrites data to make the table reading by all readers:
```
ALTER TABLE t DROP FEATURE 'typeWidening'
```
