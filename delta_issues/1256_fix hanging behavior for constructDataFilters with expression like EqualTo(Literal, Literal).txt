## Description
This fixes the hanging behavior for `constructDataFilters` with expressions like `EqualTo(Literal, Literal)`. This is due to infinite recursion caused by cases like `case EqualTo(v: Literal, a) => constructDataFilters(EqualTo(a, v))`.  This also fixes the same behavior for `EqualTo, Not(EqualTo), EqualNullSafe, LessThan, LessThanOrEqual, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqual`
