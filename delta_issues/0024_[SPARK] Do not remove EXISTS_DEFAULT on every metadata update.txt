## Description

This is a follow up to 6e9498cfc4559c5e12d8d1594edfdccf86afaca3

The previous commit assumed that that the 'EXISTS_DEFAULT' metadata key is never required in Delta. While that was probably the original intention, tit is possible to create a table that does actually require the key using `CONVERT TO DELTA`.
With this PR, we do not remove the 'EXISTS_DEFAULT' from a table on every metadata operation anymore, but only when a new table is created using either `CLONE`, `CREATE TABLE`, or `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`.

## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
