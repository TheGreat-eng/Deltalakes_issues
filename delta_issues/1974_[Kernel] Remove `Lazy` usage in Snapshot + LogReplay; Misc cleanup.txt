## Description
SnapshotImpl and LogReplay were using a complicated `Lazy` pattern, in an effort to delay loading the latest protocol and metadata for a snapshot as late as possible. There's no need to do that. You can't do anything against a snapshot unless you 1) know that this connector can understand the table protocol, and 2) you know the schema. We can just load this eagerly and simplify the code.

Also do misc indentation cleanup and re-order member variables to match the order in the constructor.

## How was this patch tested?

Minor refactor. Existing UTs.
