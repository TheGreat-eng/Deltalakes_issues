hi,
we have an in-house test where we write concurrently to the same delta table but different partitions, from multiple threads. so concurrency within a single local spark session using local filesystem.
this used to work fine with delta 0.8.0 but now with delta 1.0.0 the same test fails occasionally with some data loss.
i am not sure if a test like this is even appropriate given local mode and local filesystem limitations, but i figured i let you know just in case.

the test is here:
