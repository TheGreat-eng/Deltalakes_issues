DBR has restore to version and restore to timestamp utility commands.

Would be great to have these in the OSS version of Delta to take advantage of time travel for ops and quickly resolving data issues.

Technically, it's probably something that we could implement outside of Delta, but I would expect it to be a generally useful feature to include.
