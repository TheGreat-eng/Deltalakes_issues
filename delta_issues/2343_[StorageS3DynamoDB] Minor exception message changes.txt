## Description

I was trying to track down the source of a weird FileSystemException and eventually discovered what it meant after looking at the source code. This is a minor change to the language used to help push you into a direction to discover the actual issue. My original change was to introduce a new, more specific exception type, but that would likely be a more painful breaking change.

## How was this patch tested?

Executed unit tests locally.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, exception message text changed which if being explicitly tested against may fail.
