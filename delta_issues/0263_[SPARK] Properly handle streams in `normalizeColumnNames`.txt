## Description
`normalizeColumnNames` was always doing a select on top of its data frame which would fail for data frames with incremental execution (streams) which lead to its callers (`normalizeData`) to hack around this by not returning the normalized data frame and instead rely on propagating the fixed names through output attributes.

Fix for this is trivial as there is already a method which does select on top of data frames with incremental execution.
