Currently, Kernel doesn't support the `invariants` feature and could not write to tables on writer version 7 if their `writerFeatures` contains `invariants`.

With this change, Kernel will allow `invariants` to be present in the `writerFeatures` for tables on writer version 7, provided the schema does not define any invariants. This unblocks Kernel from writing to such tables.

Tests are added in `TableFeaturesSuite.scala`. It also added a missing integration test in `RowTrackingSuite.scala` that was previously blocked by `invariants`.
