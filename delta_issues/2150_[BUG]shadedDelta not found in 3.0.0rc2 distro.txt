## Bug
I am trying to use the rc2 build with this sbt
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.12"

resolvers +=
  "Delta OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/iodelta-1120/"

lazy val sparkVersion = "3.5.0"

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "TestDelta"
  )
val scalatestVersion = "3.2.17"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % sparkVersion,
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % sparkVersion,
  "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % scalatestVersion % "test",
  "io.delta" %% "delta-spark" % "3.0.0rc2" withSources(),
  "io.delta" %% "delta-iceberg" % "3.0.0rc2" withSources()
)

When I run with iceberge compatability, I get
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: shadedForDelta/org/apache/iceberg/types/Type$PrimitiveType
