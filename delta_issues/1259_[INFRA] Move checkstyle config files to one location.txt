## Description

Currently the java checkstyle config files are shared by some projects and stored in different locations nested under those projects. Moves the checkstyle config files to a common location. This will make it easier to compare our configs in the future and keep track of the different settings for the different projects.

## How was this patch tested?

Locally ran `checkstyle` for all the affected projects. Also modified one file and checked that the checks failed.
