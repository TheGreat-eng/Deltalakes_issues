## Description

When dropping a feature, DeltaLog now checks both backfilled and unbackfilled deltas for any traces of the feature before confirming it's safe to drop.

However, feature dropping currently does a checkpoint before detecting feature traces in the history, so there are no unbackfilled deltas at that point.
