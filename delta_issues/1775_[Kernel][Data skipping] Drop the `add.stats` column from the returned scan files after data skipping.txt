-->

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink

- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview

Right now we return the `add.stats` field silently at the end of the `add` file schema returned in the scan files. We should drop this `stats` column before returning the scan files [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/internal/ScanImpl.java#L104).

### Motivation

Don't expose unnecessary protocol details to connectors.

### Further details

This is currently hard to do since we have no way to drop a nested column. This may be unblocked by an expression on columnarbatch type interface.
