## Description
We have been changing the Kernel APIs which may cause the examples to fail. Currently, examples/integration can only be run manually. This PR runs the integration as part of the PR CI job so that we can cause any failure during the PR time.

Also fixes an issue with the integration test run script when using the local version of Kernel code.
