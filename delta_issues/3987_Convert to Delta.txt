According to the delta Lake API, I successfully converted the hive internal table to delta Lake table. The first question is whether the transformed table is the inner table of hive or the outer surface of hive. Because the data of delta Lake project can't enter hive directly, you need to connect delta Lake table through delta IO / connectors. The second problem is that hive internal tables are transformed into delta Lake tables. Can later delta Lake data directly enter the money table?
