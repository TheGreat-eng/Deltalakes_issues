## Feature request
Save data with a user-specified compression codec (like `zstd`) when using `deltaTable.optimize().executeCompaction()`.
### Overview
Currently the default compression format is `snappy `when one wants to compact the data with the built-in function `optimize()`. There is no option for users to choose the compression format at this point.

### Motivation
in specific use cases favoring compression ratio to speeds or the other way round, there exists a need to use different compression formats such as `zstd `and `lzo`.  This request is to offer the feature of allowing the user to input a certain compression format after using `compaction()`.
