### Overview
<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
Currently, it's not possible to force run a reclustering of all files in Delta, as running `OPTIMIZE {table} FULL` is not supported (see [Databricks Delta docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html#optimize-full). 


### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->
I've personally not been able to see the benefits of Delta clustering and when looking at the statistics of a Delta table, it seems like files that should be clustered together are spread out throughout multiple files. Running a partial optimization does not redistribute existing clusters across files.
