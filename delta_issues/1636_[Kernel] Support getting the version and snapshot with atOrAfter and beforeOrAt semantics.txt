### Overview

#2662 adds support for reading a snapshot of the table with beforeOrAt semantics (which aligns with SQL `TIMESTAMP AS OF` time-travel semantics).

Delta-sharing and others require additional semantics to support other use-cases (i.e. streaming)
- afterOrAt semantics
- Retrieving just the table version without constructing the snapshot (to avoid unnecessary loading of the table protocol and metadata) for both semantics

### Further details

This includes revisiting the API added in #2662 and deciding what the API surface should look like for all of these time-travel related methods.
