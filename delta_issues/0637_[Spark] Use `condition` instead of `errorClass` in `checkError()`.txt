## Description

In the PR, I propose to use the `condition` parameter instead of `errorClass` in calls of `checkError` because `errorClass` was renamed in Spark by the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48027. This PR fixes compilation issues like:
```
[error]       checkError(
[error]       ^
[error] /home/runner/work/delta/delta/spark/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/rowtracking/RowTrackingReadWriteSuite.scala:304:7: overloaded method checkError with alternatives:
[error]   (exception: org.apache.spark.SparkThrowable,condition: String,sqlState: Option[String],parameters: Map[String,String],context: RowTrackingReadWriteSuite.this.ExpectedContext)Unit <and>
```

## How was this patch tested?

By compiling locally.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No. This makes changes in tests only.
