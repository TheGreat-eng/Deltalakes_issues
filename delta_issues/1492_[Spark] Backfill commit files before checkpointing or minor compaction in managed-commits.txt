## Description

With managed-commit, commit files are not guaranteed to be present in the _delta_log directory at the time of checkpointing or minor compactions. While it is possible to compute a checkpoint file without backfilling, writing the checkpoint file in the log directory before backfilling the relevant commits will leave gaps in the directory structure. This can cause issues for readers that are not communicating with the CommitStore.

To address this problem, we now backfill commit files up to the committedVersion before performing a checkpoint or minor compaction operation
