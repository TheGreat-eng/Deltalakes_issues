Delta Lake 1.1.0 is build on spark 3.2.0. It has a bug fix for using GCS.

[The fix](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/95e90763fd9f54df8880911b28b97b023a485d5f)

but for now, It seems that GCP DataProc service only support spark 3.1.2
[GCP DataProc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/dataproc-release-2.0)

Which means that the users who uses GCS cannot enjoy this bug fix which is very critical.

I am strongly recommending back-porting this bug fix to spark 3.1.2, maybe under the version 1.0.1
