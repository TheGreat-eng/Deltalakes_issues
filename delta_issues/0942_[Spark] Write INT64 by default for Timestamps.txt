## Description

- Iceberg states in the spec that Timestamps should be written with INT64 physical types. There were already flags to enable this, but this PR makes this behavior the default.
- `INT96` is discouraged: https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/src/main/thrift/parquet.thrift#L981

## How was this patch tested?

- Added new unit-tests to validate the correct behavior
