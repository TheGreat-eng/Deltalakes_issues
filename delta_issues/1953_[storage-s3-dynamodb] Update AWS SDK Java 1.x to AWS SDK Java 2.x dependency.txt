The AWS SDK for Java 1.x is being deprecated will enter maintenance mode. To address the package deprecation, weâ€™ll need to upgrade AWS SDK Java 1.x in delta to AWS SDK Java 2.x.

Delta is undergoing an upgrade from AWS SDK Java version 1.x to version 2.x, aiming to leverage the enhanced features and improvements introduced in the latest SDK. The transition involves significant changes in the codebase, including the adoption of a builder pattern for constructing requests, a more functional programming approach utilizing lambda expressions, adjustments in response handling, and a new exception handling hierarchy (SdkServiceException). These changes contribute to improved code readability, flexibility, and compatibility with the latest AWS SDK practices.
