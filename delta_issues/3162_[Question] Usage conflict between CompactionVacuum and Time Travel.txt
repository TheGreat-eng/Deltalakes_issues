OPTIMIZE (Compaction) will double the table size, if we use VACUUM to release the space after the compaction (maybe after each data ingestion), the time travel will not be available anymore. 
I'm wondering if there's a best practice for combining compaction and time travel, or we have to bare with doubled table size.
Thank you!
