## Bug

- [x] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem

According to [the documentation](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-update.html#operation-semantics):

> A merge operation can fail if multiple rows of the source dataset match and the merge attempts to update the same rows of the target Delta table.

The following merge operation should not fail, because there is only a single source row (1, 10) that updates the target row (1, 1) after evaluating the match condition.

```sql
create table source using delta as values
  (0, 0),
  (1, 10),
  (1, 11),
  (2, 20) as (key, value);

create table target using delta as values
  (1, 1),
  (2, 2) as (key, value);

merge into target t using source s on s.key = t.key
  when matched and s.value = 10 then update set key = s.key, value = s.value;
```

But it fails when run with Delta 3.2 / Spark 3.5.

As a comparison, it works in Microsoft SQL Server 2022 and PostgreSQL 15. 

#### Steps to reproduce

Run the above SQL in Spark 3.5 with Delta 3.2.

#### Observed results

The command fails with an error saying "multiple matches not allowed".

#### Expected results

The command shouldn't fail.

### Environment information
