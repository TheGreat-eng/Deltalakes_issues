## Description
We don't need a custom patch to disable cleaning up data files for Iceberg's expire snapshots API. icebergShaded/iceberg_src_patches/0002-iceberg-core-must-not-delete-any-delta-data-files.patch

An option to disable file cleanup already exists through the `cleanExpiredFiles` API.

## How was this patch tested?
Iceberg's cleanFiles option is already tested by Iceberg. I can add separate tests here to make sure that the custom transaction logic for Uniform uses that option.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No, it preserves the existing behavior. Snapshots can be removed, but files will never be deleted.
