I run the following command to start a spark thrift server:
```bash
./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh \
--packages io.delta:delta-core_2.13:2.0.0 \
--conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" \
--conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog" \
--hiveconf hive.server2.thrift.bind.host=0.0.0.
```
And this is part of the log output:
```vim
2022-08-11 19:15:03,529 INFO service.AbstractService: Service:ThriftBinaryCLIService is started.
2022-08-11 19:15:03,557 INFO thrift.ThriftCLIService: Starting ThriftBinaryCLIService on port 10000 with 5...500 worker threads
2022-08-11 19:15:03,557 INFO service.AbstractService: Service:HiveServer2 is started.
2022-08-11 19:15:03,558 INFO thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2: HiveThriftServer2 started
```
But when I try to connect to the spark thrift server by beeline:
I got some error, as following
```bash
beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://0.0.0.0:10000
Connecting to jdbc:hive2://0.0.0.0:10000

```
Looks like it is caused by delta package is not found by beeline, but I have already add it when I start the spark thrift server.
Does anyone meet this problems before and has some insights or possible solutions?
Thanks
