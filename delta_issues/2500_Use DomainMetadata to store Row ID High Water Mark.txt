## Description

This PR removes the RowIdHighWaterMark action by using the DomainMetadata action instead. This allows us to get rid of the special `DomainMetadata`, which simplifies and speeds up log replay. As part of doing this it adds a dependency between the row tracking and domain metadata table features.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests to make sure nothing breaks.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
