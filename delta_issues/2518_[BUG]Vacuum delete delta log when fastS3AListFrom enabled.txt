## Bug
Vacuum delete delta log when fastS3AListFrom enabled
### Describe the problem
[#1210 ](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1210)
when delta.enableFastS3AListFrom=true, We change the implementation to use the [startAfter](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/s3/model/ListObjectsV2Request.html#startAfter--) parameter such that we only get keys lexicographically greater or equal than the resolved path in the S3 list response.
But S3ListRequest.v2 is recursive, and S3AFileSystem.listStatus is non-recursive. When vacuum gets allFilesAndDirs, it will not only get parquet data files, but also get delta log files, causing the delta log to be deleted.

#### Steps to reproduce
First set SparkSession config spark.hadoop.delta.enableFastS3AListFrom=trueï¼Œand set s3 related connection information.
```
spark.range(10)
      .write.mode("overwrite").format("delta")
      .save(tempDir)
spark.range(10)
      .write.mode("overwrite").format("delta")
      .save(tempDir)
io.delta.tables.DeltaTable.forPath(tempDir).vacuum(0)
```

#### Observed results
In addition to data files being cleaned up, log files are also cleaned up.
<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->

#### Expected results
Clean data files only.
<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->
