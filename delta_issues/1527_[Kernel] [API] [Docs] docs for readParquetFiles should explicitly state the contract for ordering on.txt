## Overview
The kernel docs for [readParquetFiles](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/client/ParquetHandler.java#L65) should explicitly state the contract for ordering on the columns returned.

In particular, the kernel requires that the columns be returned in the order specified in the passed schema.

## Motivation

Clear docs are essential to make sure we have correctly working connectors.
