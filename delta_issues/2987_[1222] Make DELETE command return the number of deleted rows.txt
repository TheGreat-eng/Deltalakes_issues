## Description

This PR makes the `DELETE` command in Delta Lake return the numAffectedRows metric.

## How was this patch tested?

Updated tests inside of `DeleteMetricsSuite` which now test for `numAffectedRows`. I also added a test to check explicitly for the case of deletes along partition boundaries.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. Deletes will now return the number of deleted rows.

For example,

```SQL
DELETE FROM TABLE table WHERE ...
```

will now return a DataFrame with one row with column `num_affected_rows` of type Long.
