## Description

This PR adds the ability to specify dependencies between Delta table features. When enabling a table feature all dependent table features will automatically be enabled as well. This will be used by Row Tracking to add a dependency on the Domain Metadata feature (which will be used to store the high water mark).

## How was this patch tested?

Added tests to `DeltaTableFeatureSuite` and `DeltaProtocolVersionSuite`.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
