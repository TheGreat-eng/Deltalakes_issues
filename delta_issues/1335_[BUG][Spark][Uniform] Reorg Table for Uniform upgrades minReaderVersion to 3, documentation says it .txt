### Describe the problem
Delta documentation states that:

> To enable UniForm, you must fulfill the following requirements:
> The Delta table must have a minReaderVersion >= 2 and minWriterVersion >= 7.

However when running `REORG TABLE table_name APPLY (UPGRADE UNIFORM(ICEBERG_COMPAT_VERSION=2)` it upgrades the minReaderVersion to 3, as it is in source code [HERE](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/78970abd96dfc0278e21c04cda442bb05ccde4a1/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/ReorgTableForUpgradeUniformHelper.scala#L80).

It looks like it's either a mistake in documentation or bug in a code.
