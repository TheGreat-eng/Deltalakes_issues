## Description
Uses `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util`'s `IntervalUtils.fromIntervalString` instead of `DeltaConfig`'s `parseCalendarInterval`.

The comment does say to use `CalendarInterval.fromCaseInsensitiveString`, but that method has been deprecated in favor of `IntervalUtils.fromIntervalString`.
