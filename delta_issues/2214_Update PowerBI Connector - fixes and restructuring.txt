## Description
This PR resolves [issue #1978](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1978).
During the restructuring of the project, I also fixed some other minor bugs that no one found yet 
if possible, changed my tests to use the Golden Tables instead of Delta Lake tables residing on my blob stores which partially required authentication

## How was this patch tested?
Tested with a set of Golden Tables from https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/connectors/golden-tables/src/main/resources/golden`

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No
