### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
If a writer's protocol version supports [column mapping](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#column-mapping) and the relevant column mapping property `delta.columnMapping.mode` is set, support updating the schema of the table with the necessary field-metadata (i.e adding `delta.columnMapping.id` or `delta.columnMapping.name` as needed). 

### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->

Adding this feature will allow for writers to turn on column-mapping for a table if it wasn't before. Having column-mapping is also a protocol requirement to support features like [Iceberg compatibility v2](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#iceberg-compatibility-v2)
