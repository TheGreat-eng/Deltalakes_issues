## Description
(Split from #2941)

Earlier it used to throw if the path is not valid. Now, it doesn't validate immediately. Instead the validation is done when we try to create a snapshot or other operations. We want to create tables from scratch and `Table. forPath` throwing error doesn't let us proceed.

## How was this patch tested?
