## Description
* Google maven repo URL is changed from `https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/repos/central/data/` to `https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/`. This caused more load on the central maven repo as the google maven repo is wrong.
* Currently we hard coded the URL to central maven repo for downloading the `sbt-launch-x.x.x.jar` as part of the build start. Change it to google maven repo which seems have better rate limits than the central maven repo. Also add the central maven repo as a backup so that we have two options. Example retrying:
  ```
   (base) delta2 % ./build/sbt clean package test:package
   Attempting to fetch sbt from https://eemaven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/org/scala-sbt/sbt-launch/1.9.9/sbt-launch-1.9.9.jar
   Download from https://eemaven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/org/scala-sbt/sbt-launch/1.9.9/sbt-launch-1.9.9.jar failed. Retrying from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-sbt/sbt-launch/1.9.9/sbt-launch-1.9.9.jar
  Launching sbt from build/sbt-launch-1.9.9.jar
   ```
* Add Google repo to iceberg build so that it is attempted first before the central maven repo and also as additional backup.
   * Testing
      *   Without any repo changes:
