## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [x] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem

The Flink Kubernetes Operator [Autoscaler](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-release-1.7/docs/custom-resource/autoscaler/) relies on a Source to expose a [standardised set of metrics](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-33%3A+Standardize+Connector+Metrics) in order to scale Flink jobs automatically.  
When a Flink streaming job is deployed, the job does not autoscale because these metrics do not appear to be exposed by the Flink Delta connector.  

#### Steps to reproduce

Deploy a Flink job using the Kubernetes Operator and enable autoscaling in the Flink configuration:
`job.autoscaler.enabled: "true"`.

The streaming Flink job consists of a Delta Source in continuous mode:

```
DeltaSource
    .forContinuousRowData(new Path(jobArgs.deltaSourceGcsBucket), conf)
    .startingVersion(jobArgs.startVersion)
    .build
```

Records are buffered and written to an analytics database.

#### Observed results

The Flink Kubernetes operator does not scale the job and emits a warning message:
```
[ScalingMetricCollector][WARN] pendingRecords metric for cbc3... could not be found. 
Either a legacy source or an idle source. Assuming no pending records.
```

#### Expected results

The ScalingMetricCollector is able to extract the number of pending files / records from the Delta source in order to dynamically scale up the resources allocated to the Job in Kubernetes.  This relies on the Delta source exposing the standardised metrics correctly.
