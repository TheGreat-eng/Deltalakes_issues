## Feature request
The OSS implementation will run compaction when auto-compaction is enabled if compaction hasn't been run yet. I.e. running a CTAS w/ the table property enabled will perform compaction after the write even if the small file count doesn't meet minNumFiles.

Auto compaction in Databricks does not perform this unnecessary initial compaction operation. It should only be evaluated based on the presence of small files which meet or exceed the minNumFiles.
