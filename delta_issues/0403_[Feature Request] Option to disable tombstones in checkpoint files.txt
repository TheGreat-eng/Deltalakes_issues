### Overview
I'd like to confirm what is the current usage of tombstones in the checkpoint files. I couldn't find any references to it in the code.

If they are not used, I'd suggest having an option to don't include it in the checkpoint, since is some scenarios like when running MERGE command could rewrite all the files, and the checkpoint become huge and most of the data are tombstones.

### Motivation
Tombstones are likely only wasting space and causing performance issues.
