Using Databricks runtime 8.2, with the scala or SQL APIs, I can set userMetdata with a commit. However, with python, the userMetadata option is silently ignored and the value is written as null.

```
df.write.format("delta") \
  .mode("overwrite") \
  .option("userMetadata", "overwritten-for-fixing-incorrect-data") \
  .save("/mnt/delta/events")
```

When I look at the table history after this command, the userMetadata column is still null for the commit.
