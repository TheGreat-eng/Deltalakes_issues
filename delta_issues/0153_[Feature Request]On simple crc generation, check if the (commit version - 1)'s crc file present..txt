### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

Current implementation (https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4134) generate crc_simple post commit hook at commit version only when (commit version - 1)'s crc is used for building the snapshot.

crc_simple will not present if retry happen. 

One optimization could be -- if crc at (commit version - 1) is not present, try to read it and build new crc info. This will increase the chance that crc_simple got build
