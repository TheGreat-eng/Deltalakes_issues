## Bug
INSERT INTO DELTA TABLE Fails When Specifying Only Part of the Columns in the List
### Describe the problem
If there are 10 fields in a Delta Table, if I try to Insert Data into only 5 columns using Insert into syntax, it fails saying the 6th column name is not in the Insert into column List. In SQL Server, by default it inserts NULL value in columns not specified, the same doesn't work in Delta table?
