## Feature request

### Overview

https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1312 enabled code coverage in the delta-io/delta code base, which can be run using `sbt test coverageAggregate`.

It would be great to have this report run on every PR, so PR authors can know if their changes are well tested.

### Motivation

Having well-tested code can help prevent bugs in the future.

### Further details

There is some uncertainty to this task. Are we able to see the code coverage for code changes in the PR **only**?

If not, is there a way to show the diff between the current `master` code coverage and the code coverage in the PR?
