## Feature request

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
<!--
Please add the component selected below to the beginning of the issue title
For example: [Feature Request][Spark] Title of my issue
-->

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [x] S3DynamoDBLogStore 
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview

Adjust the S3DynamoDBLogStore to be compatible with ScyllaDB's Alternator.

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

### Motivation
This adjustment aims to create a cloud-agnostic solution for the [Delta Lake on S3 Multiple Writers](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/41) issue using ScyllaDB's Alternator. It offers an open-source solution for S3 and S3-compatible storage lacking the `putIfAbsent` functionality.

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->

### Further details
The implementation includes the addition of an abstraction layer for DynamoDB LogStore (io.delta.storage.BaseDynamoDBLogStore) and introduces two implementations:

1) **io.delta.storage.DynamoDBLogStore** - for DynamoDB (no configuration changes for DynamoDB implementation).
2) **io.delta.storage.S3ScyllaDBLogStore** - for Scylla DB
The configuration details for ScyllaDB are as follows:
```
spark.delta.logStore.s3a.impl=io.delta.storage.S3ScyllaDBLogStore
spark.io.delta.storage.S3ScyllaDBLogStore.ddb.endpoint=<ScyllaDB's Alternator cluster endpoint>
spark.io.delta.storage.S3ScyllaDBLogStore.credentials.provider=<The AWSCredentialsProvider used by the client, default DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain>
spark.io.delta.storage.S3ScyllaDBLogStore.ddb.tableName=<The name of the Scylla table to use, default delta_log>
```

I've opened a PR #2410 to introduce this configuration.
