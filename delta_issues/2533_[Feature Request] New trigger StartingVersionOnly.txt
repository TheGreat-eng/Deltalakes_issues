## Feature request

### Overview

At the moment, there are two triggers which allow reading Delta table snapshot

* **Once** - it is not really streaming, tries to process everything at once so not working with big tables
* **AvailableNow** - almost what is required but not friendly to restarts because it will update stop version pointer if job is stopped and restarted

Proposal is to add **StartingVersionOnly** which works similar to **AvailableNow** but will stop query when `endOffset.isStartingVersions` turns to `false`

### Motivation

Reliable way to create one-time snapshot (at specific version) of big table which is continuously updated  **using streaming**.

`AvailableNow` can do that but it is not friendly to stop/restart which sometimes is required to fine-tune job and continue from where it stopped
