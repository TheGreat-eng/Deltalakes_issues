## Description
Currently the disabling of writing operations on DV tables added as part of #1603 is not complete. It allows following few updates:
* VACUUM can proceed if the logging is disabled - fix to always check for DV enabled table before running the VACUUM
* DVs can be enabled using table property `'delta.feature.deletionVectors'='supported'`. Consider this table property when checking for DV presence in tables
