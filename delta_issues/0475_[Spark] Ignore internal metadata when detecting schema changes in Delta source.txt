When reading from a Delta streaming source with schema tracking enabled - by specifying `schemaTrackingLocation` - internal metadata in the table schema causes a schema change to be detected.

This is especially problematic for identity columns that track the current high-water mark for ids as metadata in the table schema and update it on every write, causing streams to repeatedly fail and requiring a restart.

This change addresses the issue by ignoring internal metadata fields when detecting schema changes.

A flag is added to revert to the old behavior if needed.

## How was this patch tested?
Added test case covering problematic use case with both fix enabled and disabled.
