This PR adds two integration tests / examples for CDF, one in python and one in scala. These integration tests run insert, update, delete, and merge commands on a table with CDF enabled, and then read those CDC changes. They perform both batch and streaming reads.

You can run them using
```
python3 run-integration-tests.py --use-local --scala-only --test ChangeDataFeed
