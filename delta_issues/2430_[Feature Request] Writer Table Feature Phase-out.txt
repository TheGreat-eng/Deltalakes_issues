## Feature request

### Overview

Add support for removing writer features from a delta table. Delta needs to provide a way of removing particular Table Features from a table. 

This can be achieved as follows:
- Introduce a new alter table command for removing features, `AlterTableDropFeatureDeltaCommand`.
- Introduce a new trait, `RemovableFeature`, that all removable features must implement.
- Each removable feature may implement a `PreDowngradeTableFeatureCommand` that is responsible of removing any traces of the features in the table.
