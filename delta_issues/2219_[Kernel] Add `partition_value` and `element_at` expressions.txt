## Description
Part of delta-io/delta#2071 (Partition Pruning in Kernel). We need the following two expressions in order to evaluate predicate on scan file columnar batch data.

* `element_at(map_column, key_value)`: Take input a `map` type column and `key` value, return the `value` for the given `key`. This is similar to Apache Spark UDF for similar purposes. This expression will be used to retrieve the specific partition value from the `(partition column name -> string serialized partition)` map
* `partition_value(string_type_value, datatype)`: Decode the partition value given as a string into the given datatype format. The interpretation of the string value is according to the Delta protocol.
