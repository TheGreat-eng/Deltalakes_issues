### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

### Motivation

<!-- How will this feature be used? Why is it important? Which users will benefit from it? -->
Currently, we support Protocol downgrade in the form of feature removal but downgrading protocol versions is not possible. This feature request is about adding support for protocol version downgrade. This will allow reader/writers that support lower protocol versions to read the table.

### Further details

Protocol version downgrade should only be allowed for tables that support either reader+writer table features or writer table features. The protocol downgrade should take place when the user removes a table feature and there are no non-legacy table features left in the table. The protocol should be downgraded to the minimum reader/writer versions required to support all enabled legacy features.

For example, Protocol(3, 7, readerFeatures=(DeletionVectors), writerFeatures=(DeletionVectors, ChangeDataFeed) is downgraded to Protocol(1, 4) after removing the DeletionVectors table feature.
