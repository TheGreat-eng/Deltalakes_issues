We currently allow creating columns of type VOID for which the behavior is undefined. We should block adding such columns going forward.

Off the top of my head these are currently possible ways to add a void column (we should check these in tests)
- create/replace/.. table (SQL)
- Delta Table API
- DataFrameWriter
- alter table add column (SQL)
- adding a column via schema evolution
