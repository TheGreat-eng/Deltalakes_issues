## Description

This PR takes the existing definitions in CommitCoordinatorClient.scala and converts them to java classes/interfaces in the storage module. This is in preparation for replacing the CommitCoordinatorClient in Spark Delta with a generic java-based module that can be implemented in any Delta client.

## How was this patch tested?

This PR only copies existing definitions to java classes/interfaces in the storage module. These new classes/interfaces are not in use yet so no tests are required.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
