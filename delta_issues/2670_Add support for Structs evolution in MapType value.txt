## Description

This PR resolves issue #1641 to allow automatic schema evolution in Structs that are inside MapTypes.

The issue can be replicated with:

```
import scala.collection.JavaConverters._
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
import io.delta.tables._

val schema = StructType(
    StructField("id", IntegerType) ::
    StructField(
      "map", MapType(
        StringType, StructType(
          StructField("a", IntegerType) ::
            StructField("b", IntegerType) ::
            StructField("c", StringType) ::
            Nil
        )
      )) ::
    Nil
)

val sourceDataFrame = spark.createDataFrame(
  Seq(
    Row.fromSeq(
      Seq(0, Map("key" -> Tuple3(0, 1, "a"), "key1" -> Tuple3(2, 3, "b")))
    )).asJava, schema)

sourceDataFrame.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("delta/test")

val updatedSchema = StructType(
    StructField("id", IntegerType) ::
    StructField(
      "map", MapType(
        StringType, StructType(
          StructField("a", IntegerType) ::
            StructField("b", IntegerType) ::
            Nil
        )
      )) ::
    Nil
)

val updatedSourceDataFrame = spark.createDataFrame(
  Seq(
    Row.fromSeq(
      Seq(0, Map("key" -> Tuple2(0, 1), "key1" -> Tuple2(2, 3)))
    )).asJava, updatedSchema)

val targetDeltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "delta/test")

targetDeltaTable.alias("t").merge(
    updatedSourceDataFrame.alias("s"),
    "t.id = s.id")
  .whenMatched().updateAll()
  .whenNotMatched().insertAll()
  .execute()

//AnalysisException: cannot resolve 's.map' due to data type mismatch: cannot cast map<string,struct<a:int,b:int>> to map<string,struct<a:int,b:int,c:string>>;
```
