## Description

An opaque URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does not begin with a slash character ('/'), and are not further parsed by `java.net.URI` library (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URI.html):
```
val uri = new URI("http:example.com")
uri.isOpaque -> true
uri.isAbsolute -> true
uri.getPath -> null
```

This causes issues when we try to call path-related methods in the URIs, e.g.:
```
val filePath = new Path(uri)
filePath.toString -> "http:"
filePath.isAbsolute -> NullPointerException
```

This commit fixes this issue by detecting such URIs in Delta file actions and throwing a proper exception.
