## Bug

### Describe the problem
RESTORE operations on Delta tables don't remove set transactions. Discovered this while trying to recover from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41089. We had a corrupt checkpoint and we needed to rerun the last batch. I deleted the latest commit/offset from the checkpoint, and restored the Delta table to the version before that batch. But the set transaction remained at the version I was trying to rerun, so Delta things it already ran that version and did nothing. We had to just manually delete the delta log entries to completely rollback to retry the batch.
