## Description

This test changes when/how actions are instantiated inside of ActionSerializerSuite when passed into testActionSerDe. We change the action type from `Action` to `=> Action`. We also make the failing metadata lazy. This ensures that the metadata are instantiated after `SparkFunSuite::beforeAll` has run. This ensures that `Utils.isTesting` is true, meaning that the metadata will be instantiated with id testId.
