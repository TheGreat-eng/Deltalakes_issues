## Feature request

Feature request to support Storage Partitioned Joins (SPJ) introduced in Spark 3.3.

### Overview

Spark 3.3 added support for Storage Partitioned Joins (SPJ). A partitioned join (or partition wise join) uses data partitions to split a join into a series of smaller independent joins.

### Motivation
If two tables are partitioned by same (or subset?) set of columns, this feature can improve the performance of join/merge operations. For example - Two tables that are partitioned by hour could be joined hour-by-hour. This can especially be helpful for `MERGE INTO` operations.

This has the potential to benefit users that perform joins/merge on partitioned tables.

### Further details

1. The [Feature SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1foTkDSM91VxKgkEcBMsuAvEjNybjja-uHk-r3vtXWFE/edit#) very well documents the feature.
2. Spark support Umbrella JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37375
