## Description
The following change in Spark master broke tests in `OptimizeGeneratedColumnSuite`: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/7974811218c9fb52ac9d07f8983475a885ada81b

It added an execution of the `ConstantFolding` rule after `PrepareDeltaScan`, causing constant expressions in filters on generated columns to be simplified, which `OptimizeGeneratedColumnSuite` heavily used.

This change:
- updates the expected results in `OptimizeGeneratedColumnSuite` to simplify constant expressions
- adds a pass of `ConstantFolding` after `PrepareDeltaScan` so that Delta on spark 3.5 behaves the same as Delta on spark master.
