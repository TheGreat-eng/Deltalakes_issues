What were proposed in this Pull Request?
* avoid mutability at the method `findLastCompleteCheckpoint` and written recursive implementation.
* method `override def listFrom(path: Path)` actually returns the `Iterator` but name is `listFrom` which should be `iteratorFrom`. I came across this, when I debug the code
```
  val checkpoints =
          store
            .listFrom(checkpointPrefix(logPath, math.max(0, cur - 1000)))
```
`.iterate` was not resolved. Which remind me the method doesn't return the `List`.
