## Description

This PR adds the new `CommitCoordinatorClient` interface into `delta-kernel-api`. Notably I use `#getUnbackfilledCommits` instead of `#getCommits`.

This PR does NOT delete the existing `CommitCoordinatorClientHandler` interface in `delta-kernel-api`.

That will come in the next PR.
