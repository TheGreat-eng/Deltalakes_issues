### Describe the problem

Based on [this comment](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs/issues/1017#issuecomment-1354479597) from delta-io/delta-rs#1017 it would appear that the delta-spark implementation does not adhere to the [protocol document](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#commit-provenance-information) with regards to the `commitInfo` field:

> Implementations are free to store any valid JSON-formatted data via the `commitInfo` action.
