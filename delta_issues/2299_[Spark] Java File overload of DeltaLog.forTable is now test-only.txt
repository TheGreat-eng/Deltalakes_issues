## Description

Production Delta code doesn't use Java files -- it uses Hadoop paths -- so we can remove all references to `java.io.File` from DeltaLog.scala. Because unit tests make heavy use of Java files, we add suitable replacements in DeltaTestImplicits.scala as a convenience (and to avoid churning test code so much in this PR).

## How was this patch tested?

This change only affects unit tests, because the removed methods were not used in production code.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Methods like `DeltaLog.forTable` are internal APIs, but are not specifically marked `private` in the code. So there is a possibility that some user somewhere relies on the removed methods. But we don't guarantee backward compatibility for internal APIs so this should be acceptable.
