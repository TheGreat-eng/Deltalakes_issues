Resolves [#954](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/954)

## Description
- `DelegatingLogStore.scala` now, by default, uses the `io.delta.storage` Java `LogStore` implementations. At runtime, each of these implementations is then wrapped inside of a `LogStoreAdapter` to be used as a `LogStore.scala` throughout the delta code base.

## How was this patch tested?

Updated existing unit tests. We test setting the scheme for both the default (java) LogStores, as well as the previous scala LogStores.

Thus, if a user specifies a Scala LogStore for a given scheme, that will continue to work.
