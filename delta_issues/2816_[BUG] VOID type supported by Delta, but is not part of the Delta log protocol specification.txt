## Bug

### Describe the problem
Running
```
CREATE TABLE default.void_table (y STRING, x VOID) USING DELTA
```
will create a table with a column of type `VOID`. However `VOID` is not among the primitive types listed in [the protocol specification](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#primitive-types). Not all readers of Delta tables understands the VOID type, since it is not part of the specification, and will be unable to read such tables.

#### Steps to reproduce
```
CREATE TABLE default.void_table (y STRING, x VOID) USING DELTA
```

#### Observed results

Table is created.

#### Expected results

Table is not created, or VOID is among the primitive types of the protocol specification.
