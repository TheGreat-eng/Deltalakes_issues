## Description 

Spark 3.4 no longer requires users to provide _all_ columns in insert-by-name queries. This means Delta can now support omitting generated columns from the column list in such queries.

This test adds support for this and adds some additional tests related to the changed by-name support.

Resolves delta-io/delta#1215

## How was this patch tested?

Adds unit tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes. Users will be able to omit generated columns from the column list when inserting by name.
