## Description

As part of implementing https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2052, `OptimisticTransaction` needs the ability to track a `CatalogTable` for the table it updates. That way, post-commit hooks can reliably identify catalog-based tables and make appropriate catalog calls in response to table changes.

For now, we just define the new field, and add a new catalog-aware overload of `DeltaLog.startTransaction` that leverages it. Future work will start updating call sites to actually pass catalog information when starting a transaction.

## How was this patch tested?

The new field is currently not used, so nothing really to test. 
Existing unit tests verify the existing overloads are not broken by the change. 

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
