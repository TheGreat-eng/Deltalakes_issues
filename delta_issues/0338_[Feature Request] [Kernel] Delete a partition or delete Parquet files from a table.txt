#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
<!--
Please add the component selected below to the beginning of the issue title

### Overview

Our pipeline generates Parquet files outside of a Delta or Spark context so we use Delta Standalone to add the Parquet files to a Delta table for a partition. If the pipeline regenerates the Parquet files for a partition, we need the ability to be able to remove the old Parquet files for that partition and add the new Parquet files to the same partition. 

### Motivation

This feature will add more bulk-level updates versus row-level updates currently supported by Delta Kernel

### Further details

Delta Standalone support AddFile and Remove file operations on the Delta log via code such as the following:
```
        OptimisticTransaction txn = deltaLog.startTransaction();
        txn.commit(newFiles, new Operation(Operation.Name.UPDATE), engineInfo);
```

The Delta Kernel equivalent for AddFile ss creating `DataFileStatus` objects and then using `Transaction.generateAppendActions`. There doesn't seem to be an equivalent in the code for a `RemoveFile` operation. 

In lieu of a `RemoveFile` operation, we could work around that by having the ability to delete a partition. We can then recreate the partition via `DataFileStatus`/`Transaction.generateAppendActions` calls.
