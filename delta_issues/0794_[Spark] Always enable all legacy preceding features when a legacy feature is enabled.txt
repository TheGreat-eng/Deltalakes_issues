Currently, enabling a legacy feature on a table features protocol enables only the requested feature. On the other hand, when enabling a legacy feature on a legacy protocol we enable all preceding legacy features as well. For example, enabling `CDF` on protocol `(1, 2)` results to protocol `(1, 4)`. This means, that apart from `CDF` we also enabled `CheckConstraints` and `GeneratedColumns`.

In this PR, we fix this inconsistency by always adding preceding legacy features in all cases.
