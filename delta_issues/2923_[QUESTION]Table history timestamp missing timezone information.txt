## Bug

### Describe the problem
History timestamps are missing timezone information.

#### Steps to reproduce

```
from delta import DeltaTable

table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark_context, backend_url)
timestamp = table.history(depth).first()['timestamp']
```

#### Observed results

Retrieving the last commit timestamp from table history returns a value in the format `2022-09-21 13:45:08.100000`. This timestamp contains no timezone information. Am I to assume this is UTC?

#### Expected results

Timestamp contains timezone information.
