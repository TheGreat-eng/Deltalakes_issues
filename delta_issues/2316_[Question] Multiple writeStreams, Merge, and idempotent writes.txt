## Question

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [X] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview
We have some logic that looks like this:
```python
def x_batch(x_df: DataFrame, batch_id: int) -> None:
    // do stuff including a merge

def y_batch(y_df: DataFrame, batch_id: int) -> None:
    // do stuff including a merge

x_kafka_topic.writeStream.forEachBatch(x_batch)
y_kafka_topic.writeStream.forEachBatch(y_batch)
```
We would like to use idempotent writes for each of these batches, however, because we're using a Delta Merge operation within the `forEachBatch`, we have to set the idempotency at the `SparkSession` conf level.

Is this safe? It isn't obvious that it would be:
```python
def x_batch(x_df: DataFrame, batch_id: int) -> None:
    spark = x_df.sparkSession
    spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.write.txnAppId", f"x-{SETTINGS.version.major}")
    spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.write.txnVersion", batch_id)
    // do stuff including a merge

def y_batch(y_df: DataFrame, batch_id: int) -> None:
    spark = y_df.sparkSession
    spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.write.txnAppId", f"y-{SETTINGS.version.major}")
    spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.write.txnVersion", batch_id)
    // do stuff including a merge

x_kafka_topic.writeStream.forEachBatch(x_batch)
y_kafka_topic.writeStream.forEachBatch(y_batch)
``` 

### Motivation

I noticed in [the original feature request](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1421) asking for this that `.option(...)` would be added to `DeltaMergeBuilder`, but [it is clear from the implementation](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/f1ec3a0d77a2ab2701fbc8170adae3d5d7d10d90) that it did not get added.

If this is _not_ safe to do, then I would change this question to a feature request and allow options to be set on the `DeltaMergeBuilder`.
