### Describe the problem

When performing a DELETE operation on a Delta Table, some operational metrics are added to the Delta log / table history that contain information (attribute `operationMetrics`) like number of rows (`numDeletedRows`) and files (`numAddedFiles`, `numRemovedFiles`) deleted/added.
See: https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-utility.html#operation-metrics-keys

However, I noticed that when **_a complete partition of a partitioned table is deleted via partitionkey_**, some of those metrics are missing like the very central metric of how many rows were deleted `numDeletedRows`.

#### Steps to reproduce

```
CREATE or REPLACE TABLE TestDeletePartitioned (
  id bigint,
  part string
)
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (part)
;

INSERT INTO TestDeletePartitioned (id, part) values (1,'a'),(2,'a'),(3,'b'),(4,'b'),(5,'c'),(6,'c'),(7,'d'),(8,'d');

DELETE FROM TestDeletePartitioned WHERE id = 1;                 /* only one row is deleted from partiton part=a, one row remains in part=a */
DELETE FROM TestDeletePartitioned WHERE id IN (3, 4);           /* two row are deleted from partiton part=b what effectively corresponds to deleting the whole partition part=b */
DELETE FROM TestDeletePartitioned WHERE part = 'c';             /* complete partition part=c is deleted */
DELETE FROM TestDeletePartitioned WHERE id = 7 AND part = 'd';  /* only one row is deleted from partiton part=d, one row remains in part=d */

DESC HISTORY TestDeletePartitioned;
```

#### Observed results

When using the only the partition key for specifying the DELETE condition, the resulting entry in the Delta log does not contain all the operational metrics.

#### Expected results

I'd like to see the `numDeletedRows` metric in the log also when partitions are deleted.
