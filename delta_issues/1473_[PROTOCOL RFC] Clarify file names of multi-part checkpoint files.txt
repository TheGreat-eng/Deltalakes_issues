## Protocol Change Request

### Description of the protocol change

The naming convention for multi-part checkpoint files is ambiguous:

> A multi-part checkpoint for version n consists of p "part" files (p > 1), where part o of p is named n.checkpoint.o.p.parquet.

It's not specified that `o` and `p` are zero padded numbers of length 10, although this assumption is part of the code https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/01c0ef91565d9a3e06fb9f62295f7c80fba09351/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/internal/util/FileNames.java#L103. It would also be good to state explicitly that `n` is a zero padded number of length 20 for multi-part checkpoints and the other types of checkpoints. 

We should clarify this in the protocol.

### Willingness to contribute
