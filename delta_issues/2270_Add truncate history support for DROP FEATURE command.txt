The `DROP FEATURE` command allows to drop table features from Delta Tables. Dropping a reader+writer feature is performed in two steps:

1. We clean all traces of the feature in the latest version and inform the user they need to wait until the retention period is over.
2. After the retention period is over, the user executes the command again and the protocol is downgraded.

This PR adds the `TRUNCATE HISTORY` option in `DROP FEATURE` command. The new option is automatically sets the history retention period to minimum and cleans up metadata. This operation occurs at the second time the user invokes the operation.

Introduces the TRUNCATE HISTORY option in ALTER TABLE ... DROP FEATURE command. This can be used as follows:
