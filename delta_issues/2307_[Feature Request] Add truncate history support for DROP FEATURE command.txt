### Overview

The `DROP FEATURE` command allows to drop table features from Delta Tables. Dropping a reader+writer feature is performed in two steps:

We clean all traces of the feature in the latest version and inform the user they need to wait until the retention period is over.
After the retention period is over, the user executes the command again and the protocol is downgraded.

This feature request is about adding the `TRUNCATE HISTORY` option in `DROP FEATURE` command. The new option automatically sets the history retention period to minimum and cleans up metadata. This operation occurs at the second time the user invokes the operation.

### Motivation

The new option allows the user to drop features more easily without having to wait the default retention period or manually change the retention period.
