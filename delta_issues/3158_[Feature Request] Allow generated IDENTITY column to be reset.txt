## Feature request

### Overview

We should be allowed to reset the generated identity column in some way. Currently, it appears deleting the table completely from disk is the only way to do so.

### Motivation

You might consider adding it to the `VACUUM <table> RETAIN 0 HOURS` function. The reason why it would be helpful, is that, over time, with many inserts, we get very large numbers that are just plain obtuse. We do not need a run-away identity column, even if I have vacuumed the table.
