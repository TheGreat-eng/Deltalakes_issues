## Feature request

### Overview

We noticed that `spark.databricks.delta.merge.repartitionBeforeWrite.enabled=true`  will repartition to 1 by default and this can't be configured. It may cause OOM issue if we have a big partition. We want to control the number repartitions (number of files generated) per partition for our table. Or even better, have a configure at file size. 

### Motivation
This will let user control the number of partitions in case of large single file cause OOM error.
