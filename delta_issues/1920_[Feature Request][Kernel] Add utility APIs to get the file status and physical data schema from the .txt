### Overview
Followup from [PR](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2383/files#r1430776199).

Basically, we need utility APIs to get the physical data schema (schema of the Parquet table) from the scan state.  Otherwise, the connector needs to know the details of the scan state and extract it. In the future for any changes in the scan state contents, the connector code may need to be updated. 

Currently, the physical data schema is the same for all scan files in a query. There is also a discussion of can the schema change per-file.
