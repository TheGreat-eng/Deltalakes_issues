## Description
Support for coordinated commit introduced an issue where a Delta file in `_delta_log` that doesn't conform to the expected file name format (`%020d.json`) is considered part of the Delta history. 

We use the following method to test whether a file is a `commit` file.

Before coordinated commit support:

```
  public static boolean isCommitFile(String filePath) {
    String fileName = ..
    return Pattern.compile("\\d+\\.json").matcher(fileName).matches();
  }
```

After the coordinated commit support:
```
  public static boolean isCommitFile(String filePath) {
    String fileName = ..
    return Pattern.compile("\\d+\\.json").matcher(fileName).matches() || // backfilled commit file
        Pattern.compile("(\\d+)\\.([^\\.]+)\\.json").matcher(fileName).matches() // un-backfilled commit file
  }
```

For example, if the `_delta_log` has a file with name `0000x.uuid.json`, it will be considered to be part of the delta file, but it is not. The commit files of format `%20d.uuid.json` are considered part of the table history only if the parent directory name is `_commit`.

Update the above method as follows (this is in line with the Delta-Spark)

```
  public static boolean isCommitFile(String filePath) {
    String fileName = ...
    String parentDirName = ...
    return Pattern.compile("\\d+\\.json").matcher(fileName).matches() || // backfilled commit file
        (parentDirName == "_commit" &&
            Pattern.compile("(\\d+)\\.([^\\.]+)\\.json").matcher(fileName).matches()) // un-backfilled commit file
  }
```
