## Feature request

### Overview

Seems like only Databricks version of DeltaLake support Change Data Capture (CDC). This is such a key concept that should be made available in the open source version as well. Curious to know if you have plans to support it in future releases.

### Motivation

Customer need ability to track changes to data using DeltaLake framework as they may not have a licensed version of Databricks.
