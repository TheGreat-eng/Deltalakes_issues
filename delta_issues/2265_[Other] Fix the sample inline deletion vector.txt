## Description

Fixes the example inline deletion vector to match how the code currently works. The existing sample likely dates to an older specification and caused (me) quite a bit of confusion when I was implementing deletion vector support in our code.

Resolves #1905

## How was this patch tested?

I ran the new sample through code which successfully decodes other DVs written by Spark and confirmed that the right values came back out.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

It only updates developer-facing documentation.
