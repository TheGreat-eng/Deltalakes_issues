## Feature request
Running the query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table" should read only Delta logs

### Overview

Running the query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table" takes a lot of time for big tables, Spark scan all the parquet files just to return the number of rows, that information is available from Delta Logs.

The same for "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table Group BY PartitionColumn"
