Hello,

I have delta tables organized hierarchically like this `/raw/[source system]/[year]/[month]/[day]/[delta table]` and I would have like to read a month worth of data using a wildcard path like this:
```python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/raw/source/2020/12/*/table")
```

but I get the following exception:
```
AnalysisException: `/raw/source/2020/12/*/table` is not a Delta table.;
```

 Am I doing something wrong or is this feature not supported (yet) ?
