## Description
This change is part of the type widening table feature.
Type widening feature request: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2622
Type Widening protocol RFC: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2624

It adds the ability to remove the type widening table feature by running the `ALTER TABLE DROP FEATURE` command.
Before dropping the table feature, traces of it are removed from the current version of the table:
- Files that were written before the latest type change and thus contain types that differ from the current table schema are rewritten using an internal `REORG TABLE` operation.
- Metadata in the table schema recording previous type changes is removed.

## How was this patch tested?
- A new set of tests are added to `DeltaTypeWideningSuite` to cover dropping the table feature with tables in various states: with/without files to rewrite or metadata to remove.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
The table feature is available in testing only, there's no user-facing changes as of now.

When the feature is available, this change enables the following user action:
- Drop the type widening table feature:
```
ALTER TABLE t DROP FEATURE typeWidening
```
This succeeds immediately if no version of the table contains traces of the table feature (= no type changes were applied in the available history of the table.
Otherwise, if the current version contains traces of the feature, these are removed: files are rewritten if needed and type widening metadata is removed from the table schema. Then, an error `DELTA_FEATURE_DROP_WAIT_FOR_RETENTION_PERIOD` is thrown, telling the user to retry once the retention period expires.

If only previous versions contain traces of the feature, no action is applied on the table, and an error `DELTA_FEATURE_DROP_HISTORICAL_VERSIONS_EXIST` is thrown, telling the user to retry once the retention period expires.
