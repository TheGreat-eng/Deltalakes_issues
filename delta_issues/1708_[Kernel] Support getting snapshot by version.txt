## Description

Resolves #2275 and #2581

Adds support for `getSnapshotAtVersion` to read a specific snapshot of the Delta table.

For now, potential user-facing exceptions that are added as part of this support (i.e. invalid version provided) are added to a `DeltaErrors` file. These exceptions will be refactored as part of #2231 (and other exceptions moved to this file as well).

## How was this patch tested?

Adds unit tests. Much of the log segment building is already tested in `SnapshotManagerSuite`.
