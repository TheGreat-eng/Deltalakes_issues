## Feature request

### Overview
Currently Kernel only supports partition pruning for given predicate when reading Delta tables. This issue is to add support for file skipping using the file statistics stored in Delta Log.

### Motivation
File skipping helps improve the performance of read queries by not reading files that can not possibly have the records that satisfy the given query predicate.
