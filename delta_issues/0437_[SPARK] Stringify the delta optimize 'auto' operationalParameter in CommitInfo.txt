## Description

The `inCommitTimestamp` feature of Delta Kernel API expects the `operationalParameters` of `CommitInfo` to be a `MapType<StringType, StringType>`.  

The newly added `autoCompact` feature added the `auto` flag to `operationalParamaters` as a boolean, which is incompatible.

This PR restores that expectation of the `inCommitTimestamp` feature for the `OPTIMIZE` operation in the Spark Connector.

Resolves #3888.

We change format of the field `commitInfo.operationalParameters.auto` field from boolean to string.
