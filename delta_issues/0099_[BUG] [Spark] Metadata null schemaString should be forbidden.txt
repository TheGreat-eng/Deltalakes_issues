Spark Delta allows null schemaString, and also expects this behavior, as we have units tests relying on this, for example: `build/sbt spark/'testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.delta.OptimisticTransactionSuite -- -t "allow concurrent set-txns with different app ids"'`

And also in the ActionSerializerSuite:

#### Steps to reproduce
`build/sbt spark/'testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.delta.OptimisticTransactionSuite -- -t "allow concurrent set-txns with different app ids"'`

#### Observed results
00000000000000000000.json has:
`{"metaData":{"id":"f13d60e6-6a52-4679-8a7e-aec5b405eb29","format":{"provider":"parquet","options":{}},"partitionColumns":[],"configuration":{}}}`

#### Expected results
Error, we shouldn't allow this commit
