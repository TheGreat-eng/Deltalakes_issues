## Description

The existing Delta clone supports Iceberg as a source; However to ensure SQL syntax consistency and to make Iceberg source more explicit, this PR adds the support for `CREATE`/`REFRESH` commands for users to read existing Iceberg tables as Delta through Delta Uniform, instead of shallow clone. 

Please note that the corresponding credentials (e.g., grant read/write access to the provided path) need to be set before using the commands.

### Create a read-only delta table from an existing iceberg table

User could create a **read-only** delta table from an existing iceberg table by providing the `metadata_path` via `CREATE` command, the sql syntax is as below.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] <table_name>
UNIFORM iceberg
METADATA_PATH '<cloud-storage-uri>/metadata/<iceberg_metadata_path>'
```

User could then treat the table as a delta Uniform table and read from it.

### Refresh an existing delta uniform table once the target iceberg table gets updated

After the original iceberg table gets updated (e.g., an iceberg client write some extra data into the table), user could update the delta table accordingly via `REFRESH` command, the sql syntax is as below.

```sql
REFRESH TABLE <table_name>
METADATA_PATH '<cloud-storage-uri>/metadata/<iceberg_metadata_path>' [FORCE]
```

The delta table will be updated to reflect the status of the iceberg table based on the provided metadata version.

## How was this patch tested?

Through unit tests in `UniformIngressTableSuite.scala`, the underlying iceberg table is currently mocked by the `IcebergTestUtils.scala` via hadoop catalog.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
Yes, this PR introduces two new commands CREATE and REFRESH.

<!--
If yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.
If possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Delta Lake versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.
If no, write 'No'.
