### Describe the problem

Hi, delta-standalone published artifacts for version >= 0.3.0 includes an empty sources jar, so no sources are available 
Thanks in advance!

#### Steps to reproduce

* Download sources artifacts for any version >= 0.3.0:
  * for example https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-standalone_2.12/0.3.0/delta-standalone_2.12-0.3.0-sources.jar

#### Observed results

The downloaded jar only contains the META-INF/MANIFEST-MF file

#### Expected results

The jar should include all sources for that version, like versions <= 0.2.0:
* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-standalone_2.12/0.2.0/delta-standalone_2.12-0.2.0-sources.jar
