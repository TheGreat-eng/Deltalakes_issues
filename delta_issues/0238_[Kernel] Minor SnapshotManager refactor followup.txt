## Description

Followup to #4035.

Our SnapshotManager LogSegment construction logic is ... a bit messy, to say the least. This PR makes `getLogSegmentForVersion` _not_ return an Optional LogSegment.

I also start documenting some of the key steps in constructing a LogSegment. More steps, refactors, and comments will come in future PRs.

## How was this patch tested?

Mainly just a refactor. Existing UTs.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
