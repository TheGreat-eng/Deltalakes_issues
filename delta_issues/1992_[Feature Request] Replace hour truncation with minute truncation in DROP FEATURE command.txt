### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->
In DROP FEATURE command, we truncate history when removing reader+writer features. The cutoff time is calculated by subtracting the logRetentionPeriod/historyTruncationPeriod and then truncating the result at an hour granularity. This issue is about the hour truncation to minute truncation.
