## Overview and Requirements

Hi everyone - help is wanted!

This is the official project plan tracking the work to refactor Delta's `LogStore` classes to a new artifact `delta-storage`, and in Java (instead of Scala). The Delta `LogStore` is a general interface for all critical file system operations required to read and write the Delta log.

There are a variety of reasons for this initiative.

1. Reduce code duplication. Currently, both the [Delta Lake OSS](https://github.com/delta-io/delta) and [Delta Standalone](https://github.com/delta-io/connectors) libraries require access to this interface. However, without any separate `LogStore` artifact to depend on, any implementation needs to be duplicated accross both of these repos. We'd like to avoid that.
2. Remove the Apache Sparkâ„¢ dependency. Currently, the `LogStore` interface that the `delta-core` and `delta-contribs` artifacts use is contained within `delta-core`. This means any downstream dependencies will inherintely have to depend on Spark. As Delta Standalone is distinctly Spark-less, the current dependency hierarchy won't work.
3. No redundant Scala cross publishing. These `LogStore` implementations don't use any fancy Scala language features, and by re-writing the relatively lighweight implementations in Java we can avoid the various headaches and overhead that supporting a cross-published Scala artifact can bring.
4. This will enable us to support new lightweight and specific `LogStore` artifacts in the future. For example, for our goal to support S3 multi-cluster writes, we aim to have the [DynamoDBLogStore](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/339) (with its unique AWS SDK dependency) as its own artifact. This ensures that the specific AWS dependency isn't brought into other artifacts (e.g. `delta-contribs`).

## How to Contribute
- For any of the `LogStore`s below, please comment on the issue letting us know you'd like to work on it.
- Leave the Scala file alone for now, and create the corresponding Java file inside of `storage/src/main/java/io/delta/storage`. Refactor the `LogStore` here.
- Add a new test suite to `core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/LogStoreSuite.scala`, much like `PublicHDFSLogStoreSuite`.
- Submit your PR for review.
- See [this PR](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/933) as an example.
