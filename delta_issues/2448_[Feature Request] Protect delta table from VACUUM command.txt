## Feature request

### Overview

Add a tag to the delta table delta.vacuumDisabled = 1

### Motivation

I see that many companies started maintenance scripts that periodically vacuum tables. Additionally, the table can be vacuumed incidentally by someone. The best option would be to have availability to turn off altogether the possibility of vacuuming some tables.
