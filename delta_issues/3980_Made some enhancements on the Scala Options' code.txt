The main goal of this Pull Request is to make some code enhancements on the different Options used in this project.
Some pattern matching snippets were unnecessary since we could have treated options as collections.
for example : 

- **foreach** can replace the following code: 
```
option match {
  case None => {}
  case Some(x) => foo(x)
}
```
- **forall** can replace the following code: 
```
option match {
  case None => true
  case Some(x) => foo(x)
}
```
- **exists** can replace the following code:
```
option match {
  case None => false
  case Some(x) => foo(x)
}
```

I also removed some unnecessary pattern matching conditions which could have been anticipated using a ```getOrElse``` on the Scala Option.

These modifications were tested by running the existant tests.
