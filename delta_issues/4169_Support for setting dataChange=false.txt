The Delta transaction protocol contains the ability to mark entries in the transaction log as `dataChange=false` indicating that they are only rearranging data that is already part of the table. This is powerful as it allows you to perform compaction and other read-performance optimizations, without breaking the ability to use a Delta table as a streaming source. We should expose this as a DataFrame writer option for overwrites.
