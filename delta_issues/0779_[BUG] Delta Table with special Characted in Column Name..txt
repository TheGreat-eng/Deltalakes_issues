1. ```table_name = 'table-name-with-dashes' 
    df_bad - Dataframe with special characters "(", ")", "`" and " " in column names.
    path = dbfs:/mnt/02arch/temp  #Mounted path on Databricks. (The path is empty)
```
2. 

``` (DeltaTable.createOrReplace(spark).tableName(f"default.{table_name.replace('-', '_')}")
    .property('delta.minReaderVersion', '2')
    .property('delta.minWriterVersion', '5')
    .property('delta.columnMapping.mode', 'name')     
    .addColumns(df_bad.schema)
    .location(path)
    .execute())
```
#### Observed results

<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->
```AnalysisException: The specified properties do not match the existing properties at dbfs:/mnt/02arch/temp.

delta.columnMapping.mode=name
delta.minReaderVersion=2
delta.minWriterVersion=5

== Existing ==
delta.columnMapping.mode=name
delta.columnMapping.maxColumnId=72
