Currently, #1939 is using `DefaultRowBasedColumnarBatch::withDeletedColumnAt` to remove the `RemoveFile` column at ordinal 1 during log replay, to yield a columnar batch with only 1 `AddFile` column.

Either
- improve the performance of `withDeletedColumnAt`, or
- re-think why we are having a `DefaultRowBasedColumnarBatch` to begin with
