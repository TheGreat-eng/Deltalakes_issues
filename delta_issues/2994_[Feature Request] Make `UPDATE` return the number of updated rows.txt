## Feature request

### Overview

Currently, the `UPDATE` command does not return anything to the user. It would be more useful if we returned the number of updated rows.

### Motivation

The number of updated rows is an obvious metric that users would want from this operation.

### Further details

This should be pretty straight forward to implement - we already have access to `metrics("numUpdatedRows")` inside of `UpdateCommand.scala`. Remember to add tests, please!
