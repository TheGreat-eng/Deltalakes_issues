## Description
Currently, in order to test Delta Connect Client with Spark Connect, we always fetch the [Spark 4.0 First Preview jars](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/455dbacaf456158644bcbe8b0b13bd4eae65c974#diff-5634c415cd8c8504fdb973a3ed092300b43c4b8fc1e184f7249eb29a55511f91R308), which were created in May 2024.

Since then, lots of things have changed in [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), so the jars are outdated and the testing no longer works due to binary incompatibility between the latest version of Delta and Spark 4.0 First Preview version.

Therefore, **we are updating the `sbt` testing task of the Delta Connect Client project to automatically fetch and use the latest jars from [Spark nightly releases](https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/spark/)**.
