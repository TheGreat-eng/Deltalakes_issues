Currently, the stats are serialized using semantics similar to the `to_json` expression in Spark. `JsonHandler.parseJson` is currently used to parse the stats. It has extra non-JSON semantics such as handling timestamp, date type columns.

The delta files are serialized using the semantics of Jackson serializer and strictly contain the data types that are JSON supported types (i.e no timestamp or date types).

This task is to
* refactor these two paths into for reads and writes. 
* document the details in PROTOCOL. Currently the serialization of stats is missing.
