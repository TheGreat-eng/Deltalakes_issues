## Description

BASED OFF OF #2069; to review changes in this PR select the last 4 commits ([here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2087/files/a5073b4c14496314bae1ca97163f9e7bbc67bc6d..d160915717d683ebfd6087a93ccb224a57216d82))

Refactors the ColumnVector and Row `getArray` and `getMap` APIs to return wrapper objects. These wrappers provide APIs to retrieve column vector views of the elements or keys/values of the map/array. 

## How was this patch tested?

Supporting the new APIs in some of the java testing infrastructure was non-trivial, so this PR also moves some tests from TestDeltaTableReads to DeltaTableReadsSuite and adds the complex types to the scala testing infrastructure.

Existing tests have been modified for this PR as well as a few additional checks/tests added.
