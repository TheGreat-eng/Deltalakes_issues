We store a lot of time series data using delta format. They all have a timestamp column and are partitioned by `date(timestamp)`. 

Two common mistakes I see are
(1) forgetting to include a date filter in addition to timestamp filter
(2) partitioning output by timestamp leading to millions of output folders

The problem goes away if delta supports something like hidden partitioning in Iceberg, or specifying timestamp partition granularity (daily vs hourly) in BigQuery.
