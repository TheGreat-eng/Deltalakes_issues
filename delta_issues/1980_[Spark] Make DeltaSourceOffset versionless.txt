## Description
The DeltaSourceOffset still has a version, but it's supposed to always be VERSION_3. This turned out to not always be the case. Furthermore, it was not guaranteed that all use cases would use the new BASE_INDEX, as some of them still used a hardcoded -1. This PR removes the concept of a version from DeltaSourceOffset and makes it entirely versionless. The versioning is retained in the serialized form where it belongs.
