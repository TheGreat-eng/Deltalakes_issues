## Description

This PR addresses issue #1420 

When we try to update the versions using the [DeltaTable API](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/1c18c1d972e37d314711b3a485e6fb7c98fce96d/core/src/main/scala/io/delta/tables/DeltaTable.scala#L536) `table.upgradeTableProtocol(readerVersion, writerVersion)` it currently is only validated by the [prepareCommit](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/1c18c1d972e37d314711b3a485e6fb7c98fce96d/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/OptimisticTransaction.scala#L1147) function that validates and modifies all the actions that will be part of the transaction. Only [non-negative values requirements](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/1c18c1d972e37d314711b3a485e6fb7c98fce96d/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/OptimisticTransaction.scala#L1227) are implemented. The solution is to verify the lower and upper bounds with Action.supportedProtocolVersion() using `DeltaConfigs` validation.
