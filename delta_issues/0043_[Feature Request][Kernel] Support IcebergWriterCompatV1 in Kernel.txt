Future work

- [P0][Blocked] Update once we add clustering feature support
- [P1][Blocked] Once we support schema evolution update tests to check for adding new columns of byte/short type & for enabling schema-enabled-incompatible features on existing tables
- [P1][Blocked] Cross-test with Delta-Spark
- [P2] Update the tests in TableFeaturesSuite to use `v2Checkpoint` instead of `deletionVectors` with the iceberg compat features since it's a little weird
- [P2] Convert metadata validator/updater for writerV1 + v2 to be singleton https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4291#discussion_r2006761278
- [P2] Improve error message for incompatible features
- [P2] [Clarify comment?](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/4303#discussion_r2008347414)
