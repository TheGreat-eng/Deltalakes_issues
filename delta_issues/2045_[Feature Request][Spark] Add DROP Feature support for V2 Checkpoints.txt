### Overview

<!-- Provide a high-level description of the feature request. -->

Now that Delta supports dropping Table Features from Protocol, it would be nice to be able to drop features like V2 Checkpoints for compatibility reasons from tables.

### Further details

Adding DROP feature support for Reader-Writer features like V2 Checkpoints would involve the following steps:
1. Disabling V2 Checkpoints in table metadata to stop clients from creating more of them.
2. Remove the reliance on V2 Checkpoints for the latest Snapshot. Creating a new commit and then creating a Classic checkpoint should suffice for this.
3. Wait until all V2 Checkpoints have been cleaned up from the delta log and then drop the table feature from the Protocol.
