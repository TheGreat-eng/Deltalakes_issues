## Description
This change relaxes the condition on read-compatible type changes that the Delta streaming source can handle and recover from.

The type widening feature guarantees that all parquet readers now support reading values using a wider schema type - see `TypeWidening.isTypeChangeSupported` for the list of supported conversions.
This effectively means that the corresponding type changes are read-compatible in the context of Delta streaming sources, whether the feature is effectively enabled on the source table or not. 

## How was this patch tested?
Added tests `DeltaTypeWideningStreamingSourceSuite` cover widening, narrowing and arbitrary type changes.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
Yes. Applying a widening type change to a Delta table used as a streaming source will propagate that type change to the streaming sink instead of failing.
The write to the sink will still fail if that sink doesn't support type changes (e.g. the Delta streaming sink).
