### Describe the problem
[Domain Metadata ](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#domain-metadata) needs to be included in the checkpoint. [Action reconciliation rules](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#action-reconciliation) state that they must be included.

However, [checkpoint schema](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#checkpoint-schema) does not include domain metadata.
Can you please add more details about domain metadata to checkpoint schema section?
