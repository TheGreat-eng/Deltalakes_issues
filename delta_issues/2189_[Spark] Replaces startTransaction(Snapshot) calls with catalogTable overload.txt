## Description

This PR replaces all calls to DeltaLog.startTransaction(Snapshot) with calls to DeltaLog.startTransaction(Option[CatalogTable], Snapshot). This PR is part of https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/2105 and a follow-up to https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2125. It makes sure that transactions have a valid catalogTable attached to them so Uniform can correctly update the table in the catalog.

## How was this patch tested?

This is a small refactoring change so existing test coverage is sufficient.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
