## Description

This change improves the insert-only code path in merge to be able to support more than one `NOT MATCHED clause`. It also leverages the insert-only path for merges that have arbitrary clauses but effectively only have rows inserted after the `findTouchedFiles` step.

## How was this patch tested?
- Added test cases specifically covering merge with multiple `NOT MATCHED` clauses and merge with `MATCHED`/`NOT MATCHED` where only the `NOT MATCHED` clause is satisfied.
- Added a test to check that the insert-only code path is used when there are only inserted rows after `findTouchedFiles` by looking at the recorded operations.
- Insert-only merge are otherwise already covered by a number of different existing tests.
