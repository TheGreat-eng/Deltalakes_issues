## Bug

### Describe the problem

When reading data using table_changes_by_path the newer 2.4 version delta lake is returning two different values for overwrite operation (Insert/Delete). We noticed insert history row started showing the local timezone value and the delete row showing the UTC value for the commit timestamp field.

#### Observed results
Ex: 
Environment:  DBR 11.3 running Delta 2.1

Environment:  DBR 13.3 running Delta 2.4.0

If you notice running the following SQL for the same table history in two different environments results in two different results. If you notice the value for insert change type it is not matching what it used to be previously.
`select * from table_changes_by_path('table_path', '2021-09-15 00:00:00', '2023-12-11 06:27:57')`

I believe that the commit or changes done in the following PR commit for daylight saving time might be causing this, the change was done to CdcAddFileIndex file but the files for RemoveFileIndex don't have the same change for CDC_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP value.
