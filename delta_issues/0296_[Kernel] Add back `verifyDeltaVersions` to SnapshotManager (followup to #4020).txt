## Description

This PR basically reverts #4020 and then does a few minor additions.

#4020 removed a duplicate verifyDeltaVersions function, however, upon retrospect, those two functions had slightly different semantics. Basically, after #4020, this function is called both when asking for the changes of a table between two versions, and when constructing a Snapshot. The error messages it currently throws is not applicable to both of these different callsite invocations.

I tried a few times to keep it unified, but given that the code is so simple yet we want slightly different errors thrown, I decided just to revert the change.

## How was this patch tested?

Mainly just a revert. Existing UTs

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No.
