User-specified schema may come from the catalog if the Delta table is stored in an external catalog that syncs the table schema with the Delta log. We should allow it if it's the same as the real Delta table schema.

This is already the case for batch read, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15046

This PR changes the Delta streaming read to allow it as well.

Note: since Delta uses DS v2 (`TableProvider`) and explicitly claims that user-specified schema is not supported (`TableProvider#supportsExternalMetadata` returns false by default), end users still can't specify schema in `spark.read/readStream.schema`. This change is only for advanced Spark plugins that can construct logical plans to triggers Delta v1 source stream scan.
