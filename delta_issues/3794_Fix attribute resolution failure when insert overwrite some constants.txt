This PR will fix the resolution failure when insert overwrite some constants

How to reproduce:
```sql
-- create a partitioned delta table
CREATE TABLE t1 (a int, b int, c int) USING delta PARTITIONED BY (b, c);
```
Below three queries all failed with attributes resolution phase.
```sql
-- make sure there are two columns with same values: b=2, c=2
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE t1 PARTITION (c=2) SELECT 3, 2;
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE t1 PARTITION (b=2, c=2) SELECT 3;
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE t1 PARTITION (b=2, c) SELECT 3, 2;
```

These three queries all throw exception
> Resolved attribute(s) c#792 missing from a#793,b#794,c#795 in operator !OverwriteByExpression RelationV2[a#789, b#790, c#791] default.t1, (c#792 = cast(2 as int)), false. Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: c. Please check if the right attribute(s) are used.;;
