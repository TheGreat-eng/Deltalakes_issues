## Description

To avoid reading invalid tables, Kernel should check that any read protocol actions are supported by Kernel. This PR makes the current API private, and adds a public API around it that does this check when the `Protocol` is included in the list of actions to be read from the file.

Also removes the "byVersion" part of the API name since we are adding separate timestamp APIs in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3650.

## How was this patch tested?

Adds unit tests.
