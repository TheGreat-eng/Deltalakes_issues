## Description

<!--
- Describe what this PR changes.
- Describe why we need the change.
 
If this PR resolves an issue be sure to include "Resolves #XXX" to correctly link and close the issue upon merge.
-->

Resolves #3099 by cloning the merge command before setting a tag.

This could be also solved on the Spark side, by fixing the relation cache logic to return a copy of the cached relation instead of returning the same instance, which can cause this issue. However, that can take some time, and it doesn't change the fact that current and old Spark versions have the issue.

## How was this patch tested?

Added a test that fails without the fix with the error "org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table does not support reads", and passes with the fix.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

It is unlikely a user will notice any change with this PR. The fix copies a query plan tree and this happens all the time in the analysis/optimization/planning phases of Spark.
