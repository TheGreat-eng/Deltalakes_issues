In current update behavior, delta should: read affected files -> update -> write updated files -> delete old ones.
Here is some other ideas for this update command:
1. create a new action: UpdateFile with the update exprs
2. when update coming, first use predicate and statistics to estimate affected rows
3.1. if affected rows are relatively small, just add a UpdateFile action to DeltaLog
3.2. if affected rows are large, do the real update
4. when read coming, read the files apply UpdateFile actions in DeltaLog
5. provide a command or checkpoint mechanism to materialize the update actions

Can someone check if this idea is worth doing?
