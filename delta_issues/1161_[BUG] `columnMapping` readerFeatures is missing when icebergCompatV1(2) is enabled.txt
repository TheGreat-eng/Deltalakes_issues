### Describe the problem

[Writer Requirements for Column Mapping](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#writer-requirements-for-column-mapping) mentions:
> write a protocol action to add the feature columnMapping to both readerFeatures and writerFeatures

However, `protocol` entry doesn't have `columnMapping` in `readerFeatures` field. 

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new table with icebergCompatV1 feature:
```sql
CREATE TABLE default.test_iceberg
(a INT)
USING DELTA
LOCATION 's3://test-bucket/test_iceberg'
TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.enableIcebergCompatV1'=true);
```

2. Confirm transaction log:
```json
{"commitInfo":{"timestamp":1716541145876,"operation":"CREATE TABLE","operationParameters":{"isManaged":"false","description":null,"partitionBy":"[]","properties":"{\"delta.enableIcebergCompatV1\":\"true\",\"delta.columnMapping.mode\":\"name\",\"delta.columnMapping.maxColumnId\":\"1\"}"},"isolationLevel":"Serializable","isBlindAppend":true,"operationMetrics":{},"engineInfo":"Apache-Spark/3.5.0 Delta-Lake/3.1.0","txnId":"b172aa56-9393-4750-ac30-2c1996497efb"}}
{"metaData":{"id":"8d56ae44-1648-4fd5-a920-81f5f0725ab5","format":{"provider":"parquet","options":{}},"schemaString":"{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"a\",\"type\":\"integer\",\"nullable\":true,\"metadata\":{\"delta.columnMapping.id\":1,\"delta.columnMapping.physicalName\":\"col-39727da2-bc31-4d96-a0a9-b3f16113fde2\"}}]}","partitionColumns":[],"configuration":{"delta.enableIcebergCompatV1":"true","delta.columnMapping.mode":"name","delta.columnMapping.maxColumnId":"1"},"createdTime":1716541145862}}
{"protocol":{"minReaderVersion":2,"minWriterVersion":7,"writerFeatures":["columnMapping","icebergCompatV1"]}}
