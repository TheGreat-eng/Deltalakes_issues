## Description
We propose to introduce a new Action type called DomainMetadata to the Delta spec. In a nutshell, DomainMetadata allows specifying configurations (string key/value pairs) per metadata domain, and a custom conflict handler can be registered to a metadata domain. More details can be found in the design doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16MHP7P78cq9g8SWhAyfgFlUe-eH0xhnMAymgBVR1fCA/edit?usp=sharing).

The github issue [1741](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1741) was created.
