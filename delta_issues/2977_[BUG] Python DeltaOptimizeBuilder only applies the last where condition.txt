## Bug

With python API, when specifying several partition filters with several `where(partitionFilter: str)`, only the last one is taken into account on execution.

### Describe the problem

`DeltaOptimizeBuilder` can chain `where` functions but applies only the last one for execution

#### Steps to reproduce

1. create a delta table partitioned by `year/month/day`, for example : 
```python
DeltaTable.create(spark) \
  .tableName("events") \
  .addColumn("eventId", "BIGINT") \
  .addColumn("eventTime", "TIMESTAMP") \
  .addColumn("year", "INT", generatedAlwaysAs="YEAR(eventTime)") \
  .addColumn("month", "INT", generatedAlwaysAs="MONTH(eventTime)") \
  .addColumn("day", "INT", generatedAlwaysAs="DAY(eventTime)") \
  .partitionedBy("year", "month", "day") \
  .location("/data/events")
  .execute()
```
2. fill table with at least 2 months of data, for example 2022-01 and 2019-02
3. optimize only one daily partition
```python
DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/data/events").optimize()
        .where(f"year=2022)
        .where(f"month=01")
        .where(f"day=01")
        .executeZOrderBy("evenId")
```


#### Observed results

Both `/year=2022/month=1/day=1` and `/year=2019/month=2/day=1` partitions are optimized. Only the `day` condition is taken into account when executing optimize

#### Expected results

Only `/year=2022/month=1/day=1` should be optimized

#### Further details

Expected results can be obtained with the following code :
```python
DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/data/events").optimize()
        .where(f"year=2022 AND month=1 AND day=1")
        .executeZOrderBy("evenId")
```
