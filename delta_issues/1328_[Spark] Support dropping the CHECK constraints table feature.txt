## Description

This PR adds support for dropping the `checkConstraints` table feature using the `ALTER TABLE ... DROP FEATURE` command. It throws an error if the table still contains CHECK constraints (as dropping a feature should never change the logical state of a table).

## How was this patch tested?

Added a test to `CheckConstraintsSuite`

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, `ALTER TABLE ... DROP FEATURE checkConstraints` is now supported.
