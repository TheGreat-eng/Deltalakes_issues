- [X] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

## Description

### New Interfaces/Classes
- adds a new `ConfigurationProvider` interface, that will let kernel get per-session configurations in the future
- adds a new `TableIdentifier` class, that kernel will pass on to Commit Coordinator services
- adds a new `TableBuilder` interface, that that constructs kernel `Table` instances, with optional `config` and `tableId` params

### Cleanup
- Remove unecessary test references to code like `TableImpl.forPath(engine, tablePath, () => System.currentTimeMillis)` --> the System.currentTimeMilis is the default clock, anyways. No need to point to an internal API for that, too.

## How was this patch tested?

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
