*Motivation*

Pulsar is a cloud-native messaging and streaming platform. It has been well adopted by many companies in different regions. There is a need requested from the Pulsar community to have a native integration between Pulsar and Delta lake.

There can be many different integrations between Pulsar and Delta Lake. Here are some ideas:

1. A Pulsar source connector to capture the data changes from a Delta Lake table.
2. A Pulsar sink connector to write the Pulsar streams to Delta Lake.

This is a master issue for tracking the progress on integrating Pulsar and Delta Lake.
