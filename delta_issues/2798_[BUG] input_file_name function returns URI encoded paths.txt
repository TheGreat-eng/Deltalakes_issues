## Bug

### Describe the problem

The `input_file_name` function returns URI encoded paths. This seems to either be a bug, or an awkward user experience.

#### Steps to reproduce

```SQL
CREATE TABLE default.uri_test (part string, y long) USING delta PARTITIONED BY (part);
INSERT INTO default.uri_test VALUES ('a=b', 1);
INSERT INTO default.uri_test VALUES ('a:b', 2);
INSERT INTO default.uri_test VALUES ('a+b', 3);
SELECT *, input_file_name() FROM default.uri_test;

+----+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|part|  y|                                                                                                      input_file_name()|
+----+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| a+b|  3|    file:/tmp/4949515722967688984/uri_test/part=a+b/part-00000-30050065-24eb-4df0-b43d-363c1cc9416c.c000.snappy.parquet|
| a=b|  1|file:/tmp/4949515722967688984/uri_test/part=a%253Db/part-00000-a3d42cf8-58a1-47c6-b745-21a0666b69b2.c000.snappy.parquet|
| a:b|  2|file:/tmp/4949515722967688984/uri_test/part=a%253Ab/part-00000-9da7c976-38c9-4bfb-bf04-8595f97b7b85.c000.snappy.parquet|
+----+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Observed results
The paths are URI encoded.

#### Expected results
The expectation is for the paths to be plain URI decoded strings. For instance,
`file:/tmp/4949515722967688984/uri_test/part=a%253Db/part-00000-a3d42cf8-58a1-47c6-b745-21a0666b69b2.c000.snappy.parquet` should be `file:/tmp/4949515722967688984/uri_test/part=a%3Db/part-00000-a3d42cf8-58a1-47c6-b745-21a0666b69b2.c000.snappy.parquet` (i.e., `%253D` should be unescaped to `%3D`).
