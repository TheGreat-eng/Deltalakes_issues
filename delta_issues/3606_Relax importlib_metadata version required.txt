The current requirements for `importlib_metadata` is too strict (`importlib_metadata>=3.10.0`) and has led to it conflicting with versions required by other python libraries such as `apache-airflow` (`importlib_metadata==1.7.0`). Given that the only feature used from `importlib_metadata` is the `version()` function, and the behaviour of this function has not changed from version `1.0.0`, it is safe to relax the version required to improve compatibility with other libraries.

Thank you.
