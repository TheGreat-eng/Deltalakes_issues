It doesn't appear that the "maxRecordsPerFile" DataFrameWriter option, e.g. `df.write.option("maxRecordsPerFile", 10000)` is supported when using the "delta" format. However the behavior can still be achieved by setting the `spark.sql.files.maxRecordsPerFile` configuration property in the SparkConf.

If verified and not considered a bug, could this be a simple enhancement to implement?
