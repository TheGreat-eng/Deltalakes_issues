### Overview

In `Checkpointer::loadMetadataFromFile` we currently don't have real file size and modification time values for the last checkpoint file https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/kernel/kernel-api/src/main/java/io/delta/kernel/internal/checkpoints/Checkpointer.java#L99. We can use listFrom to get these values.
