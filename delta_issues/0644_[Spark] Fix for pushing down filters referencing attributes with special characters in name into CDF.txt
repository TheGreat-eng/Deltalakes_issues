## Description

This PR fixes the push down of filters into CDF. Previously this would cause a parsing exception to be thrown if the filter referenced an attribute with at least one special character in the name. This is due to having to turn the `Filter`s back into `Expression`s. We avoid this by extending `CatalystScan` instead, which avoids the `Expression` to `Filter` to `Expression` roundtrip.
