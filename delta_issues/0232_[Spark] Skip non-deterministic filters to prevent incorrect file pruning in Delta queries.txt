## Description

Currently, PrepareDeltaScan does not exclude non-deterministic filters (e.g. rand() < 0.25). So, it ends up creating a file index with these non-deterministic filters applied.

The same filters are reapplied downstream which causes them to be applied twice and the final result being unexpected.

In general, PrepareDeltaScan should not skip entire files/partitions because of non-deterministic filters.
