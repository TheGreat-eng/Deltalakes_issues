## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [ ] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [x] Other (Power BI)

### Describe the problem

Delta table was written with ReaderVersion 2 and ColumnMapping. So, it should be possible to read with the `Power BI` function. However, when loaded with `Power BI` the records appear twice.

They are correct when loaded with `Databricks` or in Python with `delta-rs`.


#### Steps to reproduce

Correct result:

```python
from deltalake import DeltaTable

dt = DeltaTable("dataset")
ds = dt.to_pyarrow_table()

# print(ds.to_pandas())
print(f"Number of rows: {len(ds.to_pandas())}")

# Number of rows: 13

```
Execute the function with the dataset in the attachment in `Power BI` and you get 26 records.

```M query
let
    Source = AzureStorage.DataLake("https://xy.dfs.core.windows.net/dataset), [HierarchicalNavigation = false]),
    DeltaTable = fn_ReadDeltaTable(Source),
    #"Grouped Rows" = Table.Group(DeltaTable, {}, {{"Count", each Table.RowCount(_), Int64.Type}})
in
    #"Grouped Rows"

#"Result = 26 rows"
```

#### Observed results

Duplicate values.

#### Expected results

Records should only appear once.
