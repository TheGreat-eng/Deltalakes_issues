## Description
(Stacked on top of #3289 and #3290 )

Currently, Kernel uses a mix of path (file system path) or URI (in string format) in API interfaces, which causes confusion and bugs. 

Context: 
Path refers to a file system path which could have some characters that should be escaped when converted to URI
E.g. path: `s3:/bucket/path to file/`, URI for the same path: `s3:/bucket/path%20to%20file/`

Make it uniform everywhere to just use the paths (file system path).

## How was this patch tested?
Additional tests with table path containing spaces.
