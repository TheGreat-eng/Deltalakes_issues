## Bug

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?

- [ ] Spark
- [x] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Describe the problem

`postCommit` action to create a new snapshot for checkpointing is invoked even if checkpointing is disabled via the new config `io.delta.standalone.checkpointing.enabled` available in 3.0.0rc1 version. This leads to high commit latency as the table size (number of rows/files) increases

#### Steps to reproduce

* Enable multi-threaded writes to Delta Table using a singleton `DeltaLogImpl`
* Configure the DeltaLog to not checkpoint ` conf.set("io.delta.standalone.checkpointing.enabled", "true");`
* Set any checkpoint interval in Delta Table (I used 10 and 50)

Note: This involves some bit of race-condition where thread-1 commits the version (`versionN`) which is eligible for checkpoint according to checkpointing interval. Meanwhile thread-2 has committed a new version (`versionN+1`) before thread-1 finishes the post-commit phase of (`versionN`)

#### Observed results
* When checkpoint interval is hit [shouldCheckpoint](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/c7a39da509434d6864ffc73c753af7f414fec657/connectors/standalone/src/main/scala/io/delta/standalone/internal/OptimisticTransactionImpl.scala#L396) returns true
* If commit version is different from latest snapshot version [new snapshot is created](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/c7a39da509434d6864ffc73c753af7f414fec657/connectors/standalone/src/main/scala/io/delta/standalone/internal/SnapshotManagement.scala#L249-L259)


#### Expected results
 When configured to disable checkpointing, `postCommit` snapshot recalculation from previous checkpoint should not be triggered.

Proposal

By moving the [hadoop conf check](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/c7a39da509434d6864ffc73c753af7f414fec657/connectors/standalone/src/main/scala/io/delta/standalone/internal/Checkpoints.scala#L123) for `"io.delta.standalone.checkpointing.enabled"` to [shouldCheckpoint](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/c7a39da509434d6864ffc73c753af7f414fec657/connectors/standalone/src/main/scala/io/delta/standalone/internal/OptimisticTransactionImpl.scala#L396) method all work in postCommit related to checkpoint can be skipped. 




### Environment information

* Scala version: 2.12

### Willingness to contribute

The Delta Lake Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the Delta Lake code base?

- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.
- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the Delta Lake community.
    * I have run into issues setting up the project locally. Creating the issue to get feedback on the approach proposed, while I figure out how to send a PR
- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.
