## Description

Adds support for setting and getting domain metadatas using public Kernel APIs. The protocol outlines "user-controlled" metadata domains, see https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#domain-metadata, we should support setting and getting these as part of the Kernel transaction/snapshot APIs.

## How was this patch tested?

Adds new tests as well as refactors existing test suite to use the new APIs.

NOTE: I think the way the current suite is structured could be improved, especially with these API changes. This PR does not attempt to fix that and just adds tests + adjusts current tests to use the new APIs. We can refactor this as a follow up task (lower priority).

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

Yes, adds the following public APIs
- `txnBuilder.withDomainMetadata`
- `txnBuilder.withDomainMetadataRemoved`
- `snapshot.getDomainMetadataConfiguration`
