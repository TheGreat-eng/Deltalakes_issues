### Overview

We throw a `TableNotFoundException` in a couple of scenarios (empty _delta_log folder, not a delta table, etc) on snapshot creation but sometimes on table creation (invalid path). Spend a small amount of time deciding when we should throw these errors (and maybe update the error messages to be more informative).
