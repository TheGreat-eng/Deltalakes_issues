Make the command `DESCRIBE DETAIL 'path'` also resolve the delta table name from a given path. Currently, this is not supported

### Motivation

Currently, there is no easy method to resolve this information from a given path variable. The only possibility, that I currently see is looping over the result of `spark.catalog.listTables()` and compare for each `tableName` if the path of `DESCRIBE DETAIL tableName` is identical with my given path. This is time consuming and very ineffective
