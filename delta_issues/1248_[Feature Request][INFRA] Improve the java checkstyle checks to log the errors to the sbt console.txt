### Overview

When we upgraded our `sbt` version we were forced to upgrade our the sbt java checkstyle plug in https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3019. This upgrade means that the java checkstyle errors are no longer logged to the sbt console. Fixing errors requires looking at the `$projectName/target/checkstyle-report.xml` and `$projectName/target/checkstyle-test-report.xml`. This is a poor dev workflow, and much inferior to the previous state where the errors would be printed to the console.

### Further details

We can add our own reading of the checkstyle reports and logging to console as part of our sbt build. For inspiration, we can look at the code that was used in the former sbt checkstyle plugin here https://github.com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/etsy/sbt/checkstyle/Checkstyle.scala#L70-L97
