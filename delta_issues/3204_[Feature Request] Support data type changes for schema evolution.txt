## Feature request

### Overview

Currently, schema changes are eligible for schema evolution during table appends or overwrites:
- Adding new columns
- Changing of data types from NullType -> any other type, or upcasts from ByteType -> ShortType -> IntegerType

Is it possible to support more data type changes during append operation with enabled schema evolution? 

### Motivation

For the history table updates, we want to keep all changed records as a newly appended record instead of overwriting schema when the data type has been changed from source with enabled schema evolution

For example, when the scale value of the decimal type is changed from 2 to 4 and the precision is kept unchanged

```scala
//i.e. data type of one column is changed from decimal(38,2) to decimal(38,4)
df.write.format("delta").option("mergeSchema", "true").mode("append").save(targetPath)
```

The error is `Failed to merge decimal types with incompatible scale 2 and 4`

Can this decimal scale change be supported in Delta schema evolution during table appends and please review other data types as well?
