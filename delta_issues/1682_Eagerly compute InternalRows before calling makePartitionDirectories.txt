## Description

Minor refactoring in [TahoeFileIndex.scala](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/2633/files#diff-bd55057ac76812c275eae15225d360f1bb6b2d997a095dee512a1eb9ab1686aa). We push the computation of `InternalRow` down before calling `makePartitionDirectories`. This significantly improves the edge-side without causing any side-effects on the non-edge-side. By doing this we are able to cache the result, instead of recomputing it repeatedly on the edge-side. Additionally `InternalRow` is more memory-efficient than `Map[String, String]` which also improves the memory utilization.
