I understand this might be by design, but https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-batch.html#add-columns could be made more clear. It currently says,

> By default, nullability is true.

which gives me an impression that one can override the nullability, but I got

```
spark-sql (default)> ALTER TABLE basic ADD COLUMNS (col1_nonnull2 integer NOT NULL);
[DELTA_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED] Operation not allowed: `NOT NULL in ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS` is not supported for Delta tables
```

Also, note that due to #831, you cannot change an existing nullable column to non-nullable. This means the ONLY way to have a non-nullable column is to do so when creating the table.
