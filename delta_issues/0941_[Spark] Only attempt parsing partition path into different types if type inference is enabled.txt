## Description
I was looking at this code path for another issue and noticed that when parsing partition values from paths (only used for the write path) without type inference we still attempt to due parsing for date/decima/timestamp types even though it's not required. We can avoid that work with a small refactoring.

## How was this patch tested?
This is a refactoring/minor optimization where existing unit tests will exercise this path

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
