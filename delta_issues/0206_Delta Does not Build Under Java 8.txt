## Bug

### Describe the problem

#### Steps to reproduce

1. git clone https://github.com/delta-io/delta.git
2. build/sbt compile (with a newer JVM: I can repro this with  Java 11 and Java 17, both on OSX and Ubuntu

#### Observed results

Compilation errors

```
[error] /home/anoop/delta/iceberg/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/icebergShaded/IcebergConversionTransaction.scala:35:8: not found: object shadedForDelta
[error] import shadedForDelta.org.apache.iceberg.{AppendFiles, DeleteFiles, OverwriteFiles, PendingUpdate, RewriteFiles, Transaction => IcebergTransaction}
```

This happened because the build script used in Uniform (`delta/icebergShaded/generate_iceberg_jars.py`) fails because of a Gradle error. 

With JDK8, the build succeeds cleanly.

#### Expected results

Users should be able to build/test Delta with newer JDK versions.
