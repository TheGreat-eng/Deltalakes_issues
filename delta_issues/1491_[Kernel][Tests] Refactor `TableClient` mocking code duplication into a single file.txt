## Description
We have been duplicating the mocking `TableClient` across the test suites. Consolidate and make common utilities/classes that allow mocking `TableClient` with minimal code.

`MockTableClientUtils.scala` - is the base trait for mocking `TableClient`.

## How was this patch tested?
Just a refactor
