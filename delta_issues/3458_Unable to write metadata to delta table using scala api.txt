Extension to #321 

When using an api like the one below, the only supported method to write metadata is through the use of the sparkSession which works until a single spark session is performing multiple writes simultaneously. In this case, manipulating the spark session still doesn't provide the ability to pass accurate metadata to the table. Could we find a way to ensure metadata writes are possible at the writer level even when using the following syntax?
Thanks
