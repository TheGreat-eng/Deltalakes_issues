## Description

This PR fixes the coordinated commits utils to not write UUID-based commit files with put-if-absent semantics. This is not necessary because we assume that UUID-based commit files are globally unique so we will never have concurrent writers attempting to write the same commit file.

DynamoDBCommitCoordinator also now uses the utils for writing backfilled files.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests are sufficient as this only affects how a commit is
written in the underlying storage layer but does not change any logic in
Delta Spark.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?

No
