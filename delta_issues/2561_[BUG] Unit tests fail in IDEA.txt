## Bug

### Describe the problem
Many unit tests fail to run in IDEA due to the resource file path, e.g.,

```
object DeletionVectorsSuite {
  val table1Path = "src/test/resources/delta/table-with-dv-large"
  ...
}
```

_No such file or directory: file:xxxxx/delta/src/test/resources/delta/table-with-dv-large/_delta_log_

#### Observed results

<!-- What happened?  This could be a description, log output, etc. -->

#### Expected results

It is better to call the helper functions in SparkFunSuite
```
  // helper function
  protected final def getTestResourceFile(file: String): File = {
    new File(getClass.getClassLoader.getResource(file).getFile)
  }

  protected final def getTestResourcePath(file: String): String = {
    getTestResourceFile(file).getCanonicalPath
  }
```
Such as 
`val table1Path = getTestResourcePath(delta/table-with-dv-large)`
#### Steps to reproduce
