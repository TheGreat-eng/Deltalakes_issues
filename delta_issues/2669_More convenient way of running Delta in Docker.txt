## Feature request

### Overview
I have been following this guideline in order to setup pytest for a delta code in Docker: https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html#python but it does not work. I get the following error:

>  return jvm.io.delta.tables.DeltaTable.isDeltaTable(jsparkSession, identifier)
>  TypeError: 'JavaPackage' object is not callable

I tried the same thing with a regular python code (not a unit test) and I still get the error. The python code works only if I invoke it like this `spark-submit --packages io.delta:delta-core_2.12:{Delta Lake version} PATH/TO/EXAMPLE`. Is there a way to invoke pytest like this?

### Motivation
Will save more time on devopsing if there is an out of the box feature to run delta (pytest) code  in Docker
### Further details

If this is not a proper space for issues like this please redirect me to the right place.
