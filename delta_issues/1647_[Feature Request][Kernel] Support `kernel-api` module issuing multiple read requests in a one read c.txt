## Feature request
Currently during the table state reconstruction, `kernel-api` requests to read one file (either a commit file or single checkpoint file from mulit-part checkpoint file) at a time. Once the data from that file is fully consumed, it issues the next request. Instead, `kernel-api` module should make read requests for multiple files at a time (the current TableClient APIs allow this), so that the implementations of TableClient may prefetch the data for the files that are going to be read next to speed up the reads.
