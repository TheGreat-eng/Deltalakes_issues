## Description

This PR updates the Delta Lake VACUUM command to work with V1 and V2 tables.

It rewrites the Delta VACUUM command to use Spark's table resolution logic instead of resolving the target table manually at command execution time. For that, it changes `VacuumTableCommand` from a `LeafRunnableCommand` to a `UnaryLike` command that takes an `UnresolvedTable` as a child plan node, which will be resolved by Spark. In addition, it also uses an `UnresolvedDeltaPathOrIdentifier ` LogicalPlan for the case that VACUUM is run against a raw path. This logical plan is an indication that the target table is specified as a path so no table resolution is necessary.
