## Description

This is a plain refactor of REORG TABLE / OPTIMIZE to allow for better extendability and adding new types of REORG TABLE operations in the future.

The REORG operation currently supports:
- PURGE: remove soft deleted rows (DVs) and dropped columns.
- UPGRADE UNIFORM: rewrite files to be iceberg compatible.

More operations can be used in the future to allow dropping table features, in particular for column mapping: rewrite files to have the physical column names match the logical column name.

## How was this patch tested?

This a plain refactor without functional changes.
