## Bug

### Describe the problem

As mentioned in this issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs/pull/651 and again in this issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1216, currently `RemoveFile.numRecords` is being written out to the delta checkpoint. This is a bug, as the field is clearly marked as `JsonIgnoreProperty` in the `RemoveFile` class declaration [here](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/v1.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/actions/actions.scala#L351).

We should explicitly block this field from being written to the delta log checkpoint.

#### Steps to reproduce

Write out any `RemoveFile` to a delta log checkpoint (i.e. commit 10 times) and, when reading that checkpoint parquet file, you will see that `numRecords` field has been written out.
