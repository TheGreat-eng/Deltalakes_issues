## Description

Adds `ScanReport` for reporting a Scan.

We record `ScanReport` either after all the scan files have successfully been consumed (and the iterator closed), or if an exception is thrown while reading/filtering/preparing the scan files to be returned to the connector. This is done within the `hasNext` and `next` methods on the returned iterator since that is when we do all of the kernel work/eval (since the iterator is lazily loaded). We only record a report for failures that happen within Kernel, if there are failures from within the connector code, no report will be emitted.

We also add support for serializing `ScanReport` in this PR.
