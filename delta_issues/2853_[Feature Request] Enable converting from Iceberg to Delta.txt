## Feature request

### Overview

Enable converting parquet-backed Iceberg tables to Delta tables without rewriting parquet files. This new Delta Table will need to be at least protocol version { reader=2, writer=5 } as Column Mapping will be needed during the conversion.

### Motivation

We want to make it easier for users to convert their existing Iceberg tables to Delta tables and start experiencing all the wonderful benefits of Delta! Having a native Iceberg converter that doesn't rewrite parquet files should help smoothen this transition.

### Further details

We will have to think about what this API / module / JAR / artifact, etc. will look like. Would love to hear feedback and thoughts from the community!
