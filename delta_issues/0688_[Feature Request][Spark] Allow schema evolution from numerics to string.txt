### Overview

I have an interesting problem with how my company evolves their data naturally within our own ecosystem. We have a bunch of ids that starts off as longs but eventually evolves into strings. This causes delta to oftentimes break and require manual intervention for schema evolutions.

Ideally we can add functionality that allows for automatic schema evolution from numerics into strings.
