## Feature request
Running the query `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE partition_column = 1` should only read Delta log statistics.

@felipepessoto https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1192 / https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/0c349da8 already introduced this feature for `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table` in Delta 2.2.0.
I suggest further improving this feature so it also works for **partitioned tables when filtering only on partition columns**.

#### Which Delta project/connector is this regarding?
- [x] Spark
- [ ] Standalone
- [ ] Flink
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] Other (fill in here)

### Overview
Running the query `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE partition_column = 1` takes a lot of time for big tables, Spark scans the parquet files just to return the number of rows. But the row count is already available from Delta Logs.

### Motivation
Significant performance improvement.
