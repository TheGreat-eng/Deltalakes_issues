## Description
Resolves https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1357

As streaming uses the latest schema to read historical data batches and column mapping schema changes (e.g. rename/drop column) can cause latest schema to diverge, we decided to temporarily completely block streaming read on column mapping tables before.

As a close follow up in this PR, we think it is at least possible to enable the following use cases:

Read from a column mapping table without rename or drop column operations.
Upgrade to column mapping tables.
Existing compatible schema change operations such as ADD COLUMN.

## How was this patch tested?
New unit tests.

## Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing changes?
No
