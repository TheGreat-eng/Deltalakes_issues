Drop feature with checkpoint protection allows dropped features to live in the table history. This has consequences in the vacuum command. This is because vacuum only reads the latest snapshot, and uses that to decide what can be deleted or not. This could lead clients that do not support past feature(s) to incorrectly vacuum auxiliary files, unless the latest snapshot can prevent this from happening using only features from the reduced protocol. The way that the table snapshot prevents deletion of files is by referencing files that were recently removed from the table (in the last 7 days) in RemoveFile actions or "tombstones".

This is problematic when a newer feature extends the functionality of these tombstones. For instance, the Deletion Vectors feature has `RemoveFile` actions that contain a reference both to the main file as well as the auxiliary Deletion Vector file. But after the downgrade, clients will not see that auxiliary DV file reference anymore, and will not preserve Deletion Vectors that were only removed from the table within the past 7 days.

This PR resolves this issue by ensuring that the auxiliary files are referenced by adding RemoveFile actions during the pre-downgrade process of Deletion Vectors.
