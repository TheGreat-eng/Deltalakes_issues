## Feature request

### Overview

The Delta specification was recently extended to include Row IDs, which can be used to uniquely identify a row across multiple versions of a table. We now propose this to extend this with a Row Commit Version, which can be used together with the Row ID to uniquely identify a version of a row, by storing the last commit version in which the row was either inserted or updated (but not copied to a different file).

### Motivation

Can be used together with Row IDs to maintain derived tables.
